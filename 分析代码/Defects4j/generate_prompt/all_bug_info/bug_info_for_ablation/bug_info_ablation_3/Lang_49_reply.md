The bug appears when reducing fractions with negative numerators. The current code only takes the absolute value of the numerator for GCD calculation but doesn't preserve the sign in the final result. Here's the fixed version:

```java
/**
     * <p>Reduce the fraction to the smallest values for the numerator and
     * denominator, returning the result.</p>
     * 
     * <p>For example, if this fraction represents 2/4, then the result
     * will be 1/2.</p>
     *
     * @return a new reduced fraction instance, or this if no simplification possible
     */
    public Fraction reduce() {
        int gcd = greatestCommonDivisor(Math.abs(numerator), denominator);
        if (gcd == 1) {
            return this;
        }
        return Fraction.getFraction(numerator / gcd, denominator / gcd);
    }
```

Wait, actually the code looks correct as is. The error message suggests that for some input, it expected 1 but got 100, which implies the GCD calculation might be incorrect or the fraction isn't being reduced properly. Let me provide a more robust version:

```java
/**
     * <p>Reduce the fraction to the smallest values for the numerator and
     * denominator, returning the result.</p>
     * 
     * <p>For example, if this fraction represents 2/4, then the result
     * will be 1/2.</p>
     *
     * @return a new reduced fraction instance, or this if no simplification possible
     */
    public Fraction reduce() {
        if (numerator == 0) {
            return Fraction.getFraction(0, 1);
        }
        int gcd = greatestCommonDivisor(Math.abs(numerator), Math.abs(denominator));
        if (gcd == 1) {
            return this;
        }
        return Fraction.getFraction(numerator / gcd, denominator / gcd);
    }
```

The key changes are:
1. Added special handling for 0 numerator
2. Take absolute value of denominator as well for GCD calculation
3. The sign is preserved naturally through the division operations

This should handle all cases correctly, including negative fractions and proper reduction.
