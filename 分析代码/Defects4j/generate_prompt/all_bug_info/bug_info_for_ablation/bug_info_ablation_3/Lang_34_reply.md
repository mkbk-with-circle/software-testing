## Fixed code
```java
/**
     * <p>
     * Returns the registry of objects being traversed by the <code>reflectionToString</code>
     * methods in the current thread.
     * </p>
     *
     * @return Set the registry of objects being traversed
     */
    static Map<Object, Object> getRegistry() {
        return REGISTRY.get();
    }
```

The bug was that the original code was returning an empty map when REGISTRY.get() was null, but the test expected null in that case. I removed the ternary operator that was providing the empty map fallback, so now it will simply return whatever REGISTRY.get() returns (including null).
