Based on the error message, the issue seems to be that the method is returning 0 (no translation) when it should be returning 3 (indicating 3 characters were consumed). The problem likely occurs when the input length is exactly equal to the index plus the shortest sequence length. Here's the fixed code:

```java
public int translate(final CharSequence input, final int index, final Writer out) throws IOException {
    int max = longest;
    if (index + longest > input.length()) {
        max = input.length() - index;
    }
    // descend so as to get a greedy algorithm
    for (int i = max; i >= shortest; i--) {
        if (index + i > input.length()) {
            continue;
        }
        final CharSequence subSeq = input.subSequence(index, index + i);
        final CharSequence result = lookupMap.get(subSeq);
        if (result != null) {
            out.write(result.toString());
            return i;
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
```

The key change is adding a check `if (index + i > input.length())` inside the loop to skip iterations where the subsequence would go beyond the input length. This ensures we don't try to create invalid subsequences when the remaining input is shorter than the current iteration's length but longer than the shortest allowed sequence.
