The issue is that the FastDateFormat class needs to implement Serializable to support serialization. Here's the fixed code:

```java
/**
 * {@inheritDoc}
 */
public String toString() {
    return "[" + mObj1 + ':' + mObj2 + ']';
}
```

Note: The actual fix would require making the FastDateFormat class implement Serializable, but since you only asked for the toString() method code block to be returned, I'm returning it unchanged as it wasn't the source of the serialization error. The serialization error occurs because the containing class FastDateFormat needs to implement Serializable, not because of this toString() method.

To fully fix this, the class declaration should be:
```java
public class FastDateFormat implements Serializable {
    // class implementation
}
```

But since you only asked for the toString() code block, that's what I've returned.
