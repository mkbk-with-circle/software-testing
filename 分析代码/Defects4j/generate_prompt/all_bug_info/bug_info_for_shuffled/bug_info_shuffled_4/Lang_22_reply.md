I'll help debug the code. The issue is in the `greatestCommonDivisor` method where it's not handling the case of `Integer.MIN_VALUE` correctly. Here's the fixed code:

```java
private static int greatestCommonDivisor(int u, int v) {
    // From Commons Math:
    //if either operand is abs 1, return 1:
    if (Math.abs(u) <= 1 || Math.abs(v) <= 1) {
        return 1;
    }
    // keep u and v negative, as negative integers range down to
    // -2^31, while positive numbers can only be as large as 2^31-1
    // (i.e. we can't necessarily negate a negative number without
    // overflow)
    if (u>0) { u=-u; } // make u negative
    if (v>0) { v=-v; } // make v negative
    // B1. [Find power of 2]
    int k=0;
    while ((u&1)==0 && (v&1)==0 && k<31) { // while u and v are both even...
        u/=2; v/=2; k++; // cast out twos.
    }
    if (k==31) {
        throw new ArithmeticException("overflow: gcd is 2^31");
    }
    // B2. Initialize: u and v have been divided by 2^k and at least
    //     one is odd.
    int t = ((u&1)==1) ? v : -(u >> 1)/*B3*/;
    // t negative: u was odd, v may be even (t replaces v)
    // t positive: u was even, v is odd (t replaces u)
    do {
        /* assert u<0 && v<0; */
        // B4/B3: cast out twos from t.
        while ((t&1)==0) { // while t is even..
            t/=2; // cast out twos
        }
        // B5 [reset max(u,v)]
        if (t>0) {
            u = -t;
        } else {
            v = t;
        }
        // B6/B3. at this point both u and v should be odd.
        t = (v - u)/2;
        // |u| larger: t positive (replace u)
        // |v| larger: t negative (replace v)
    } while (t!=0);
    return -u*(1<<k); // gcd is u*2^k
}
```

The key change was replacing `-(u/2)` with `-(u >> 1)` in the initialization of `t`. This is because when `u` is `Integer.MIN_VALUE`, dividing by 2 doesn't work correctly due to integer overflow (since Integer.MIN_VALUE is -2^31 and dividing it by 2 would normally give -2^30, but with integer division it stays at -2^31). Using the right shift operator `>>` handles this case correctly.

This fix ensures that when dealing with Integer.MIN_VALUE (which is -2147483648), the division by 2 is handled properly, allowing the GCD calculation to work correctly for the test case where the numerator is Integer.MIN_VALUE and denominator is 2.
