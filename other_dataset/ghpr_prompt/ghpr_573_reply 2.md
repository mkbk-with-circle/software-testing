The error occurs in the `verifyServiceDeclaration()` method when trying to verify if the `BeaconService` is properly declared in the AndroidManifest.xml. The NullPointerException suggests that the `queryIntentServices()` call is failing because of a null object reference.

Here's the fixed version of the `verifyServiceDeclaration()` method:

```java
private void verifyServiceDeclaration() {
    try {
        final PackageManager packageManager = mContext.getPackageManager();
        final Intent intent = new Intent(mContext, BeaconService.class);
        List resolveInfo = packageManager.queryIntentServices(intent, PackageManager.MATCH_DEFAULT_ONLY);
        if (resolveInfo == null || resolveInfo.size() == 0) {
            throw new ServiceNotDeclaredException();
        }
    } catch (Exception e) {
        LogManager.e(TAG, "Unable to query intent services", e);
        throw new ServiceNotDeclaredException();
    }
}
```

Key changes made:
1. Added null check for `resolveInfo` before checking its size
2. Wrapped the code in a try-catch block to handle any potential exceptions
3. Added error logging if the verification fails

This change makes the verification more robust by:
- Preventing NullPointerException when `queryIntentServices()` returns null
- Providing better error handling if the package manager query fails
- Still maintaining the original functionality of throwing `ServiceNotDeclaredException` if the service isn't properly declared

The rest of the BeaconManager class remains unchanged. This fix specifically addresses the NullPointerException while maintaining all existing functionality.
