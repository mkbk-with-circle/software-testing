Here's the fixed code that prevents the NullPointerException by ensuring the Glide instance is fully initialized before it's made available:

```java
public static Glide get(Context context) {
    if (glide == null) {
        synchronized (Glide.class) {
            if (glide == null) {
                Context applicationContext = context.getApplicationContext();
                GlideBuilder builder = new GlideBuilder(applicationContext);
                List<GlideModule> modules = parseGlideModules(applicationContext);
                for (GlideModule module : modules) {
                    module.applyOptions(applicationContext, builder);
                }
                Glide instance = builder.createGlide();
                for (GlideModule module : modules) {
                    module.registerComponents(applicationContext, instance);
                }
                glide = instance;
            }
        }
    }

    return glide;
}
```

The key changes are:

1. Created a local `instance` variable to hold the Glide instance during initialization
2. Only assigned the instance to the static `glide` field after all initialization is complete (both `applyOptions` and `registerComponents` calls)
3. This ensures that when other threads get the Glide instance via the static field, it's fully initialized with all components registered

This fixes the race condition where another thread could get a partially initialized Glide instance, which could lead to NullPointerExceptions when trying to use components that hadn't been registered yet.
