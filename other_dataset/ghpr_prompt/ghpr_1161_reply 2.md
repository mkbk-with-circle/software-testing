Here's the fixed code for the `taskReload` method in TextureManager.java. The issue was caused by modifying the list while iterating over it, which can lead to index out of bounds exceptions. I've replaced the indexed loop with an iterator-based approach:

```java
public void taskReload() {
    Iterator<ATexture> iterator = mTextureList.iterator();
    while (iterator.hasNext()) {
        ATexture texture = iterator.next();
        if (texture.willRecycle()) {
            iterator.remove();
        } else {
            taskAdd(texture, true);
        }
    }
}
```

This change:
1. Uses an iterator to safely traverse and modify the list
2. Removes the manual index management which was error-prone
3. Maintains the same functionality but in a more robust way
4. Will prevent the ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException that was occurring

The iterator approach is both safer and more efficient when you need to modify a collection while iterating through it.
