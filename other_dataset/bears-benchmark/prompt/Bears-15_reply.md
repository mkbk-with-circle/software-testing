Based on the test failure, the issue appears to be with the `@JsonIdentityReference(alwaysAsId=true)` annotation not being properly handled when applied at the class level. The test expects the `alwaysClass` field to be serialized as just the ID (1) but it's being serialized as a full object (`{"id":1,"value":13}`).

Here's the fix for the `JacksonAnnotationIntrospector` class:

```java
@Override
public ObjectIdInfo findObjectReferenceInfo(Annotated ann, ObjectIdInfo objectIdInfo) {
    JsonIdentityReference ref = _findAnnotation(ann, JsonIdentityReference.class);
    if (ref != null) {
        objectIdInfo = objectIdInfo.withAlwaysAsId(ref.alwaysAsId());
    }
    // Also check if class itself has @JsonIdentityReference
    if (ann instanceof AnnotatedClass) {
        JsonIdentityReference classRef = _findAnnotation(ann, JsonIdentityReference.class);
        if (classRef != null) {
            objectIdInfo = objectIdInfo.withAlwaysAsId(classRef.alwaysAsId());
        }
    }
    return objectIdInfo;
}
```

The fix adds support for checking `@JsonIdentityReference` at the class level in addition to the field/method level. When the annotation is found at the class level, it applies the `alwaysAsId` setting to the `ObjectIdInfo` just like it does for field-level annotations.

This ensures that when `@JsonIdentityReference(alwaysAsId=true)` is used at the class level (as in `Value1607ViaClass`), objects of that class will be serialized as just their ID rather than full objects, matching the expected behavior in the test case.
