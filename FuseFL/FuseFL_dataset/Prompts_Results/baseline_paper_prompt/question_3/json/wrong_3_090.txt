      "reason": "This line compares the current element `i` with a slice of the list `lst` from index 0 to `i-1`. However, this comparison is incorrect because `lst[:i]` should be `lst[:lst.index(i)]` to check for duplicates before the current element. The current implementation is likely to raise a `TypeError` since `i` is an integer and cannot be used as a slice index."

      "codeContent": "continue",
      "reason": "If the condition in line 5 is true, the `continue` statement will skip the rest of the loop body, which means the current element `i` will not be added to the `result` list. This will result in missing elements in the output list."

      "reason": "The use of `result += [i]` is inefficient. It creates a new list for each element `i` and then concatenates it with the `result` list. A more efficient approach would be to use `result.append(i)`."
