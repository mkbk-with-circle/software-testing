This line compares the current element `i` with a slice of the list `lst` from index 0 to `i-1`. However, this comparison is incorrect because `lst[:i]` should be `lst[:lst.index(i)]` to check for duplicates before the current element. The current implementation is likely to raise a `TypeError` since `i` is an integer and cannot be used as a slice index.
