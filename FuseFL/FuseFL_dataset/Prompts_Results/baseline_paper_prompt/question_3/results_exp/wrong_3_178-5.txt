This line of code is potentially faulty. The expression 'lst[n] + lst[n+1:].remove(lst[n])' tries to concatenate the first element of the list with the result of removing that element from the remaining list. However, the concatenation may not work as expected, and the modified list is not assigned back to 'lst', so the changes are not reflected in the subsequent iterations.
