      "code": "elif x >= seq[-1]:",
      "explanation": "The condition checks if x is greater than or equal to the last element of the sequence. However, this condition should be inclusive to maintain the sorted order. Changing it to 'x > seq[-1]' will fix the issue."

      "code": "elif x <= seq[0]:",
      "explanation": "The condition checks if x is less than or equal to the first element of the sequence. Similar to the previous line, this condition should be inclusive. Changing it to 'x < seq[0]' will resolve the problem."

      "explanation": "This condition checks if the sequence is empty. However, the task description states that if the sequence is empty, the function should return 0. Changing it to 'if not seq:' will correctly handle the case of an empty sequence."

      "explanation": "This line returns the length of the sequence when x is greater than or equal to the last element. However, it should return the position of the last element instead. Changing it to 'return len(seq) - 1' will give the correct result."

      "explanation": "The loop iterates over the elements of the sequence, but it doesn't make use of the index 'i'. Instead, we should iterate over the indices using 'for i, val in enumerate(seq):'. This change will ensure the correct index is returned when x is less than an element in the sequence."
