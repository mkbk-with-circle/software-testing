      "code": "if type(seq) == tuple:",
      "explanation": "The code checks if the type of `seq` is a tuple. However, the task description does not mention any specific requirement for the type of `seq`. This condition is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results."

      "faultyLine": 12,
      "code": "elif type(seq) == list:",
      "explanation": "Similar to the previous line, this condition checks if the type of `seq` is a list. However, it is unnecessary and not mentioned in the task description. This condition can also lead to incorrect results."

      "faultyLine": 13,
      "code": "lst = []",
      "explanation": "The variable `lst` is initialized as an empty list. This line is not faulty itself, but it is suspicious because it is part of the faulty block mentioned in Line 12. If Line 12 is faulty, then this line can also contribute to the incorrect results."

      "faultyLine": 14,
      "code": "for i in seq:",
      "explanation": "This line starts a loop that iterates over the elements of `seq`. If the code block within this loop is faulty, it can lead to incorrect results."

      "code": "return len(lst) - 1",
      "explanation": "This line returns the length of the list `lst` minus 1. If the code block within the loop is faulty, it can result in an incorrect length of `lst` and, consequently, an incorrect return value."
