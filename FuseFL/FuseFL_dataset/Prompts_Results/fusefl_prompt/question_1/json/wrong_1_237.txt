      "code": "if x <= seq[-1]:",
      "explanation": "This line is causing an IndexError when seq is empty because it tries to access the last element seq[-1] without checking if the sequence is empty or not."

      "code": "return len(seq)",
      "explanation": "This line is returning the length of the sequence seq when x is greater than all the elements in seq. However, the task description states that if seq is empty, the function should return 0. So, this line is not handling the case of an empty sequence correctly."

      "faultyLine": 3,
      "code": "for i in range(len(seq)):",
      "explanation": "This line initializes a loop to iterate over the indices of seq. While this line itself is not faulty, it becomes unnecessary if the sequence is empty, as there are no elements to iterate over."

      "faultyLine": 4,
      "code": "if seq[i] < x:",
      "explanation": "This line checks if the current element seq[i] is less than x. However, this condition is not required to find the correct position for x. It only serves to continue the loop, which can be achieved using continue directly."

      "faultyLine": 5,
      "code": "continue",
      "explanation": "This line is used to skip the remaining code in the loop if the condition seq[i] < x is true. However, since the loop only contains the continue statement and no other code, this line is redundant."
