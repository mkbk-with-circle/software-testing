Instead of comparing seq with an empty tuple () or an empty list [], it should check if seq is an empty tuple or an empty list using the len() function. The correct condition should be if len(seq) == 0: or if seq == (): for an empty tuple."

However, in this code, it returns 0 regardless of whether the sequence is empty or not. This line should be moved inside the condition on line 2, so it only returns 0 when the sequence is empty."
