This line checks if the value `x` is smaller than the current element `elem` in the sequence. If this condition is true, it means `x` should be inserted at position `i` in the sequence. However, this logic is incorrect because it assumes that the sequence is sorted in ascending order. If the sequence is sorted in descending order, the condition should be `if x > elem` instead.
