This line checks if the input sequence seq is empty. However, the condition is incorrect. Instead of comparing seq with an empty tuple () or an empty list [], it should check if seq is an empty tuple or an empty list using the len() function. The correct condition should be if len(seq) == 0: or if seq == (): for an empty tuple.
