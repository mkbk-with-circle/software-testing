This line checks if the sequence `seq` is empty or if `x` is less than or equal to the first element of `seq`. The error in the test case `search(100, [])` occurs because the condition `seq == []` is redundant and should be removed. The condition `if seq == ():` is unnecessary since an empty sequence is represented as an empty list `[]` in Python. The correct condition to check if `seq` is empty is `if len(seq) == 0:`. Therefore, the line should be modified to `if len(seq) == 0 or x <= seq[0]:`.
