      "explanation": "The line appends the i-th element of the sorted list 'lst' to the 'new' list. Since the function should return the greatest k number of values in descending order, this line is potentially faulty because it appends elements in ascending order instead of descending."

      "code": "lst.sort()",
      "explanation": "The line sorts the input list 'lst' in ascending order. However, the task description states that the function should return the greatest k values in descending order. Therefore, this line is potentially faulty as it sorts the list in the wrong order."

      "explanation": "The line iterates over the range from 0 to k-2 (inclusive). This range is incorrect because it should iterate over the range from 0 to k-1 (inclusive) to include the k-th greatest value. As a result, the function may not return the correct number of values."
