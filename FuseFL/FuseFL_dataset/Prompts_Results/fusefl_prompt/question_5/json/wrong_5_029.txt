This line should be modified to reverse the list and then return the sliced portion."

      "explanation": "This line iterates over the list 'lst', but it is followed by incorrect indentation. The subsequent lines should be indented to be inside the loop, but they are not. This causes the logic of the code to be incorrect, leading to incorrect results. The indentation should be fixed."

The subsequent lines should be indented to be inside the loop, but they are not. This causes the logic of the code to be incorrect, leading to incorrect results. The indentation should be fixed."
