      "explanation": "Popping elements from the list while iterating over it can lead to unexpected behavior and incorrect results. It is recommended to create a separate list of indices to be removed and then remove them after the loop."

      "explanation": "The condition checks if the current element lst[i] is equal to the maximum value in the list lst. However, max(lst) will change as elements are removed from the list. The condition should be modified to compare lst[i] with the maximum value before the loop starts."

      "explanation": "Using negative indices can lead to confusion and potential off-by-one errors. It would be safer and more readable to iterate over the indices using range(len(lst)) and then access the elements using lst[i]."
