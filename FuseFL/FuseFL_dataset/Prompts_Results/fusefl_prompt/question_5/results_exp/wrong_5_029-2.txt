This line initializes an empty list 'sorted_list', but it is not used correctly in the subsequent lines. The code attempts to append elements to 'sorted_list', but the appending logic is incorrect. The correct logic to sort the elements is missing, resulting in incorrect results. The code should be modified to correctly sort the elements in 'sorted_list'.
