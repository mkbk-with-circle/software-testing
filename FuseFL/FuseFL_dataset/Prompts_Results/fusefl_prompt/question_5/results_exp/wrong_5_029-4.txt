This line initializes the variable 'smallest' with the first element of the list 'lst'. However, it is followed by incorrect indentation. The subsequent lines should be indented to be inside the loop, but they are not. This causes the logic of the code to be incorrect, leading to incorrect results. The indentation should be fixed.
