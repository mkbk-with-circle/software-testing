      "explanation": "The loop variable `i` is assigned the value of `l`, which is an integer and not an iterable object. To fix this, we need to change the loop statement to iterate over a range of values up to `l`, instead of iterating over `l` itself."

      "explanation": "The variable `l` is assigned the length of the input list `lst`, which is correct. However, it is not directly related to the error. It is included in the fault localization results due to the Ochiai score assigned by the SBFL technique."
