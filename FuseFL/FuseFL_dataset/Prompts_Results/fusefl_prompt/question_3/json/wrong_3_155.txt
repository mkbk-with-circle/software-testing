      "explanation": "The line 'result += ele' is potentially faulty because it tries to concatenate an integer 'ele' to the list 'result'. This operation is not valid since the '+=' operator expects an iterable object on the right-hand side, but 'ele' is an integer."

      "explanation": "The line 'if ele not in result:' is potentially faulty because it checks if 'ele' is not in 'result' correctly. However, the subsequent code does not handle the case when 'ele' is not in 'result'. This can lead to incorrect results."

      "faultyLine": 2,
