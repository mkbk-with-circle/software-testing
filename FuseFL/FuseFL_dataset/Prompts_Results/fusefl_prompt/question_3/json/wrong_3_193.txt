    {
      "faultyLine": 7,
      "code": "if rev_lst[i] in rev_lst[i+1:]:",
      "explanation": "The line is causing a 'TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable' error. This occurs because the 'reverse()' method of a list returns None and does not return a new reversed list. Therefore, 'rev_lst' is None, and when trying to access elements using indexing, the error is raised."

    {
      "faultyLine": 2,
      "code": "count=0",
      "explanation": "This line initializes the 'count' variable, but it is not used anywhere in the code. It seems to be unnecessary and can be removed."
    },
    {
      "faultyLine": 3,
      "code": "rev_lst=lst.reverse()",
      "explanation": "The 'reverse()' method of a list reverses the list in-place and returns None. Assigning the result of 'lst.reverse()' to 'rev_lst' will set 'rev_lst' as None and not the reversed list. This is not the intended behavior."
    },
    {
      "faultyLine": 4,
      "code": "ori_len=len(lst)",
      "explanation": "The 'ori_len' variable is assigned the length of 'lst' at the beginning of the function. However, this length is not used anywhere in the subsequent code. It seems to be unnecessary and can be removed."
    },
    {
      "faultyLine": 5,
      "code": "new_lst=lst.copy()",
      "explanation": "The 'copy()' method is used to create a shallow copy of the list 'lst' and assign it to 'new_lst'. However, since 'lst' is not modified later in the code, there is no need to create a copy. This line can be removed."
