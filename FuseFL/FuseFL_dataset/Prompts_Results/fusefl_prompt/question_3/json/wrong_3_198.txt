However, 'x' is an integer, not an iterable object, which causes the 'TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable'. To fix this, we should use the 'append()' method to add 'x' to the 'new' list."

This line is considered potentially faulty because it could lead to incorrect results if line 5 is fixed to use 'append()' instead of '+='. If line 5 is not fixed, this line would not cause any issues."
