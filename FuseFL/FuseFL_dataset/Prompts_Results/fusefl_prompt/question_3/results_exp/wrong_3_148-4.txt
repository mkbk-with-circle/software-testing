The line 'if i not in lst2:' is potentially faulty because it incorrectly checks if 'i' is not in 'lst2'. This condition is not sufficient to remove repeated occurrences of elements. To correctly remove repeated elements, we need to use a set to keep track of unique elements. We can modify the code by creating a set 'seen' to store elements that have already been encountered. Then, we can check if 'i' is not in 'seen' instead of 'lst2'.
