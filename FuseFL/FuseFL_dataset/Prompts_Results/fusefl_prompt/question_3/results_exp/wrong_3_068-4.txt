The line checks if `i` is not in `lst`. However, this condition will always evaluate to `False` because `i` is an element of `lst` (due to the loop). It seems that the intention is to check if `i` occurs more than once in `lst`. To achieve this, we need to modify the code to count the occurrences of `i` and check if the count is greater than 1.
