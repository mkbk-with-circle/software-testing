The line checks if the current element 'x' is not already present in the 'new' list. If it's not, the code proceeds to line 5. This line is considered potentially faulty because it could lead to incorrect results if line 5 is fixed to use 'append()' instead of '+='. If line 5 is not fixed, this line would not cause any issues.
