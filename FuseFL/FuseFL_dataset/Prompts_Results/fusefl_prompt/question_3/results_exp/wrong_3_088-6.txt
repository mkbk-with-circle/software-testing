The line is an `elif` condition that checks if the current element `elem` is present in the remaining portion of the list (`lst[lst.index(elem)+1:]`). However, the usage of `lst.index(elem)` will always return the index of the first occurrence of `elem`, which won't work correctly for subsequent occurrences.
