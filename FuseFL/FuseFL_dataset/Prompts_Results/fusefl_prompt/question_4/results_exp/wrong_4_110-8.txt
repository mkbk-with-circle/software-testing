This line initializes an empty tuple tpl, but it is not used correctly in the subsequent code. The intention seems to be assigning the tuple with the largest age, but instead, it remains empty. As a result, the code fails to remove the desired tuple from the list, leading to the ValueError mentioned in the test results.
