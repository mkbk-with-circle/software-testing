The line `lst.remove(person)` is incorrect because it is also placed inside the `if` condition block. Similar to the previous line, this will only remove a person from `lst` if their age is greater than the current `oldest`. However, we need to remove all people from `lst` after appending them to `newlst`, regardless of their age. Moving this line outside the `if` condition block will resolve the issue.
