    {
      "faultyLine": 8,
      "code": "lst.remove(biggest)",
      "explanation": "The variable 'biggest' is not defined in the code. It seems there is a typo in line 8, where 'biggest' should be replaced with 'oldest', which is the correct variable representing the oldest person."

    {
      "faultyLine": 6,
      "code": "if i[1] > oldest[1]:",
      "explanation": "The comparison in line 6 is incorrect. It should be checking if 'i[1]' is greater than 'oldest[1]', not 'biggest[1]'. Changing 'biggest' to 'oldest' in the comparison will fix this issue."
    },
    {
      "faultyLine": 5,
      "code": "for i in lst:",
      "explanation": "The loop in line 5 iterates over the list 'lst'. However, the variable 'i' is used inconsistently in the loop. It should be replaced with a more meaningful variable name, such as 'person' or 'member', to improve code readability."
    },
    {
      "faultyLine": 4,
      "code": "oldest = lst[0]",
      "explanation": "The initialization of 'oldest' in line 4 is incorrect. It should be 'oldest = lst[0]' instead of 'oldest = lst[1]'. This change ensures that the oldest person is correctly assigned initially."

      "faultyLine": 2,
      "code": "sort = []",
      "explanation": "Although line 2 is not directly causing the errors, it is unnecessary and can be removed. The variable 'sort' is not used anywhere in the code, so it serves no purpose."
