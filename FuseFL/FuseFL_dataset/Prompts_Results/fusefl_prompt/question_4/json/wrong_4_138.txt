    {

      "code": "while lst: # a is not []",
      "explanation": "The loop condition 'while lst' is potentially faulty because it assumes that 'lst' is not an empty list. However, the task description mentions that the input list can be empty, so this condition needs to be modified."

      "faultyLine": 3,
      "code": "smallest = lst[0]",
      "explanation": "The assignment 'smallest = lst[0]' is potentially faulty because it assumes that 'lst' has at least one element. However, when the input list is empty, this line will raise an IndexError. This needs to be handled properly."

    {
      "faultyLine": 4,
      "code": "for element in lst:",
      "explanation": "The 'for' loop 'for element in lst:' is potentially faulty because it assumes that 'lst' has at least one element. However, when the input list is empty, this loop will not execute, and subsequent lines will raise errors. This needs to be handled properly."

      "faultyLine": 5,
      "code": "if element[1] < smallest[1]:",
      "explanation": "The condition 'if element[1] < smallest[1]:' is potentially faulty because it assumes that both 'element' and 'smallest' are tuples with at least two elements. However, when the input list is empty, this condition will raise errors. This needs to be handled properly."

    {
      "faultyLine": 7,
      "code": "lst.remove(smallest)",
      "explanation": "The line 'lst.remove(smallest)' is potentially faulty because it modifies 'lst' while iterating over it. This can lead to unexpected behavior and incorrect results. A different approach should be used to avoid modifying the list during iteration."
