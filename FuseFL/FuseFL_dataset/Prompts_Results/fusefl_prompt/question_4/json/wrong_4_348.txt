      "code": "return [tup]",
      "explanation": "The line returns the sorted list as a single-element list containing the `tup` tuple. However, the expected output is a list of tuples, not a list containing a single tuple. This line should be modified to return the sorted elements as separate tuples within a list."

      "code": "tup=tuple(i)+tup",
      "explanation": "The line concatenates the current tuple `i` with the existing `tup` tuple. However, the order of concatenation is incorrect. It should be `tup = (i,) + tup` to ensure the older people are at the front of the list."

      "code": "current=0",
      "explanation": "This line initializes the `current` variable to 0. However, it seems unnecessary for sorting the list of people based on age. The `current` variable is not used elsewhere in the code, so it can be considered potentially faulty."

      "code": "tup=()",
      "explanation": "This line initializes an empty tuple `tup`. However, it doesn't seem to serve any purpose in the sorting process. It is not used directly for sorting or storing the sorted results. Therefore, it can be considered potentially faulty."
