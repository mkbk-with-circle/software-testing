Faulty Code:
```python
def search(x, seq):
    if seq == [] or (): 
        return 0
    elif len(seq) == 1:
        if seq[0] < x:
            return 0
        else: 
            return 1
    elif seq[-1] <= x:
        return len(seq)
    elif seq[0] >= x:
        return 0
    else:
        for i in range(len(seq)):
            if x >= seq[i] and x <= seq[i+1]:
                return i + 1
```

Task Description:
The `search` function takes in a value x and a sorted sequence seq, and returns the position that x should go to such that the sequence remains sorted. If the element x is found, it should return the first posible position. If the seq is empty, it should return 0. 

Test Results:
The provided code is producing incorrect results. For example:
- Running the function as follows `search(10, (-5, -1, 3, 5, 7, 10))` yields `6` instead of the expected `5`.
- Running the function as follows `search(-100, ())` generate an `IndexError: tuple index out of range` in line 9 `elif seq[-1] <= x:`.

Spectrum-based Fault Localization (SBFL) Techniques Results:
We have used SBFL techniques to identify potentially faulty lines. Here are the results of top-5 suspicious lines sorted in descending order of the score:
1. Line 4 `elif len(seq) == 1:`, Ochiai score: 0.239046
2. Line 9 `elif seq[-1] <= x:`, Ochiai score: 0.239046
3. Line 2 `if seq == [] or ():`, Ochiai score: 0.227921
4. Line 10 `return len(seq)`, Ochiai score: 0.218218
5. Line 11 `elif seq[0] >= x:`, Ochiai score: 0.000000

Analyze the provided code and utilize task description, test results, and SBFL techniques results to help in identifying potentially faulty lines. Provide the results following this JSON template:
```json
{
  "faultLoc": [
    {
      "faultyLine": (indicating the line number of the suspicious code),
      "code": (displaying the actual code),
      "explanation": (step by step reasoning on why this location is considered potentially faulty)
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```
Ensure that the objects in the "faultLoc" array are sorted in descending order of suspicion.
