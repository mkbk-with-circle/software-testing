Faulty Code:
```python
def search(x,seq):
    if type(seq) == tuple:
        tup = ()
        for i in seq:
            if i < x:
                tup = tup + (i,)
            else:
                tup = tup + (x,)
                break
        return len(tup) - 1
        
    elif type(seq) == list:
        lst = []
        for i in seq:
            if i < x:
                lst.append(i)
            else:
                lst.append(x)
                break
        return len(lst) - 1
        
```

Task Description:
The `search` function takes in a value x and a sorted sequence seq, and returns the position that x should go to such that the sequence remains sorted. If the element x is found, it should return the first posible position. If the seq is empty, it should return 0. 

Test Results:
The provided code is producing incorrect results. For example:
- Running the function as follows `search(42, (-5, 1, 3, 5, 7, 10))` yields `5` instead of the expected `6`.
- Running the function as follows `search(42, [1, 5, 10])` yields `2` instead of the expected `3`.
- Running the function as follows `search(100, [])` yields `-1` instead of the expected `0`.
- Running the function as follows `search(-100, ())` yields `-1` instead of the expected `0`.

Spectrum-based Fault Localization (SBFL) Techniques Results:
We have used SBFL techniques to identify potentially faulty lines. Here are the results of top-5 suspicious lines sorted in descending order of the score:
1. Line 2 `if type(seq) == tuple:`, Ochiai score: 0.257130
2. Line 12 `elif type(seq) == list:`, Ochiai score: 0.246183
3. Line 13 `lst = []`, Ochiai score: 0.246183
4. Line 14 `for i in seq:`, Ochiai score: 0.246183
5. Line 20 `return len(lst) - 1`, Ochiai score: 0.246183

Analyze the provided code and utilize task description, test results, and SBFL techniques results to help in identifying potentially faulty lines. Provide the results following this JSON template:
```json
{
  "faultLoc": [
    {
      "faultyLine": (indicating the line number of the suspicious code),
      "code": (displaying the actual code),
      "explanation": (step by step reasoning on why this location is considered potentially faulty)
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```
Ensure that the objects in the "faultLoc" array are sorted in descending order of suspicion.
