Faulty Code:
```python
def search(x, seq):
    l=len(seq)
    if x<=seq[0]:
        return 0
    elif x>=seq[l-1]:
        return l+1
    else:
        for i in range (l):
            if x>=seq[i] and x<=seq[i+1]:
                return i+1
            else:   
                continue
```

Task Description:
The `search` function takes in a value x and a sorted sequence seq, and returns the position that x should go to such that the sequence remains sorted. If the element x is found, it should return the first posible position. If the seq is empty, it should return 0. 

Test Results:
The provided code is producing incorrect results. For example:
- Running the function as follows `search(42, (-5, 1, 3, 5, 7, 10))` yields `7` instead of the expected `6`.
- Running the function as follows `search(42, [1, 5, 10])` yields `4` instead of the expected `3`.
- Running the function as follows `search(10, (-5, -1, 3, 5, 7, 10))` yields `7` instead of the expected `5`.
- Running the function as follows `search(100, [])` generate an `IndexError: list index out of range` in line 3 `if x<=seq[0]:`.
- Running the function as follows `search(-100, ())` generate an `IndexError: tuple index out of range` in line 3 `if x<=seq[0]:`.

Spectrum-based Fault Localization (SBFL) Techniques Results:
We have used SBFL techniques to identify potentially faulty lines. Here are the results of top-5 suspicious lines sorted in descending order of the score:
1. Line 6 `return l+1`, Ochiai score: 0.433013
2. Line 2 `l=len(seq)`, Ochiai score: 0.376889
3. Line 3 `if x<=seq[0]:`, Ochiai score: 0.376889
4. Line 5 `elif x>=seq[l-1]:`, Ochiai score: 0.283473
5. Line 8 `for i in range (l):`, Ochiai score: 0.000000

Analyze the provided code and utilize task description, test results, and SBFL techniques results to help in identifying potentially faulty lines. Provide the results following this JSON template:
```json
{
  "faultLoc": [
    {
      "faultyLine": (indicating the line number of the suspicious code),
      "code": (displaying the actual code),
      "explanation": (step by step reasoning on why this location is considered potentially faulty)
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```
Ensure that the objects in the "faultLoc" array are sorted in descending order of suspicion.
