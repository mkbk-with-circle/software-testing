Faulty Code:
```python
def search(x, seq):
    if seq == () or seq == []:
        return 0
    elif x <= seq[0]:
        return 0
    elif x >= seq[-1]:
        return len(seq) - 1
    else:
        seq_enum = [i for i in enumerate(seq)]
        for j in range(len(seq_enum) - 1):
            if x >= seq_enum[j][1] and x <= seq_enum[j+1][1]:
                return j+1
```

Task Description:
The `search` function takes in a value x and a sorted sequence seq, and returns the position that x should go to such that the sequence remains sorted. If the element x is found, it should return the first posible position. If the seq is empty, it should return 0. 

Test Results:
The provided code is producing incorrect results. For example:
- Running the function as follows `search(42, (-5, 1, 3, 5, 7, 10))` yields `5` instead of the expected `6`.
- Running the function as follows `search(42, [1, 5, 10])` yields `2` instead of the expected `3`.

Spectrum-based Fault Localization (SBFL) Techniques Results:
We have used SBFL techniques to identify potentially faulty lines. Here are the results of top-5 suspicious lines sorted in descending order of the score:
1. Line 7 `return len(seq) - 1`, Ochiai score: 0.408248
2. Line 6 `elif x >= seq[-1]:`, Ochiai score: 0.267261
3. Line 4 `elif x <= seq[0]:`, Ochiai score: 0.235702
4. Line 2 `if seq == () or seq == []:`, Ochiai score: 0.213201
5. Line 9 `seq_enum = [i for i in enumerate(seq)]`, Ochiai score: 0.000000

Analyze the provided code and utilize task description, test results, and SBFL techniques results to help in identifying potentially faulty lines. Provide the results following this JSON template:
```json
{
  "faultLoc": [
    {
      "faultyLine": (indicating the line number of the suspicious code),
      "code": (displaying the actual code),
      "explanation": (step by step reasoning on why this location is considered potentially faulty)
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```
Ensure that the objects in the "faultLoc" array are sorted in descending order of suspicion.
