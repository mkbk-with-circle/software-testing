Faulty Code:
```python
def search(x, seq):
    count=0
    while count<len(seq):
        if x>seq[count]:
            count+=1
            continue
        else:
            return count-1
            break
    return len(seq)
        
```

Task Description:
The `search` function takes in a value x and a sorted sequence seq, and returns the position that x should go to such that the sequence remains sorted. If the element x is found, it should return the first posible position. If the seq is empty, it should return 0. 

Test Results:
The provided code is producing incorrect results. For example:
- Running the function as follows `search(5, (1, 5, 10))` yields `0` instead of the expected `1`.
- Running the function as follows `search(7, [1, 5, 10])` yields `1` instead of the expected `2`.
- Running the function as follows `search(3, (1, 5, 10))` yields `0` instead of the expected `1`.
- Running the function as follows `search(-5, (1, 5, 10))` yields `-1` instead of the expected `0`.
- Running the function as follows `search(10, (-5, -1, 3, 5, 7, 10))` yields `4` instead of the expected `5`.
- Running the function as follows `search(-100, (-5, -1, 3, 5, 7, 10))` yields `-1` instead of the expected `0`.
- Running the function as follows `search(0, (-5, -1, 3, 5, 7, 10))` yields `1` instead of the expected `2`.

Spectrum-based Fault Localization (SBFL) Techniques Results:
We have used SBFL techniques to identify potentially faulty lines. Here are the results of top-5 suspicious lines sorted in descending order of the score:
1. Line 8 `return count-1`, Ochiai score: 0.429198
2. Line 4 `if x>seq[count]:`, Ochiai score: 0.378517
3. Line 2 `count=0`, Ochiai score: 0.342381
4. Line 3 `while count<len(seq):`, Ochiai score: 0.342381
5. Line 5 `count+=1`, Ochiai score: 0.306570

Analyze the provided code and utilize task description, test results, and SBFL techniques results to help in identifying potentially faulty lines. Provide the results following this JSON template:
```json
{
  "faultLoc": [
    {
      "faultyLine": (indicating the line number of the suspicious code),
      "code": (displaying the actual code),
      "explanation": (step by step reasoning on why this location is considered potentially faulty)
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```
Ensure that the objects in the "faultLoc" array are sorted in descending order of suspicion.
