Faulty Code:
```python
def search(x, seq):
    n = len(seq)
    for i in range(0,n):
        currentvalue = seq[i]
        position = i
        if position >= 0 and x>currentvalue:
            position = i+1
        elif position >= 0 and x<= currentvalue:
            return position
        elif seq==():
            return 0
    return position
```

Task Description:
The `search` function takes in a value x and a sorted sequence seq, and returns the position that x should go to such that the sequence remains sorted. If the element x is found, it should return the first posible position. If the seq is empty, it should return 0. 

Test Results:
The provided code is producing incorrect results. For example:
- Running the function as follows `search(100, [])` generate an `UnboundLocalError: local variable 'position' referenced before assignment` in line 12 `return position`.
- Running the function as follows `search(-100, ())` generate an `UnboundLocalError: local variable 'position' referenced before assignment` in line 12 `return position`.

Spectrum-based Fault Localization (SBFL) Techniques Results:
We have used SBFL techniques to identify potentially faulty lines. Here are the results of top-5 suspicious lines sorted in descending order of the score:
1. Line 12 `return position`, Ochiai score: 0.408248
2. Line 2 `n = len(seq)`, Ochiai score: 0.246183
3. Line 3 `for i in range(0,n):`, Ochiai score: 0.246183
4. Line 4 `currentvalue = seq[i]`, Ochiai score: 0.000000
5. Line 5 `position = i`, Ochiai score: 0.000000

Analyze the provided code and utilize task description, test results, and SBFL techniques results to help in identifying potentially faulty lines. Provide the results following this JSON template:
```json
{
  "faultLoc": [
    {
      "faultyLine": (indicating the line number of the suspicious code),
      "code": (displaying the actual code),
      "explanation": (step by step reasoning on why this location is considered potentially faulty)
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```
Ensure that the objects in the "faultLoc" array are sorted in descending order of suspicion.
