Faulty Code:
```python
def search(x, seq):
    for i in range(len(seq)):
        if seq[i] < x:
            continue
        elif seq[len(seq)] < x:
            return len(seq)
        else:
            return i
    """ Takes in a value x and a sorted sequence seq, and returns the
    position that x should go to such that the sequence remains sorted """
```

Task Description:
The `search` function takes in a value x and a sorted sequence seq, and returns the position that x should go to such that the sequence remains sorted. If the element x is found, it should return the first posible position. If the seq is empty, it should return 0. 

Test Results:
The provided code is producing incorrect results. For example:
- Running the function as follows `search(42, (-5, 1, 3, 5, 7, 10))` yields `None` instead of the expected `6`.
- Running the function as follows `search(42, [1, 5, 10])` yields `None` instead of the expected `3`.
- Running the function as follows `search(5, (1, 5, 10))` generate an `IndexError: tuple index out of range` in line 5 `elif seq[len(seq)] < x:`.
- Running the function as follows `search(7, [1, 5, 10])` generate an `IndexError: list index out of range` in line 5 `elif seq[len(seq)] < x:`.
- Running the function as follows `search(3, (1, 5, 10))` generate an `IndexError: tuple index out of range` in line 5 `elif seq[len(seq)] < x:`.
- Running the function as follows `search(-5, (1, 5, 10))` generate an `IndexError: tuple index out of range` in line 5 `elif seq[len(seq)] < x:`.
- Running the function as follows `search(10, (-5, -1, 3, 5, 7, 10))` generate an `IndexError: tuple index out of range` in line 5 `elif seq[len(seq)] < x:`.
- Running the function as follows `search(-100, (-5, -1, 3, 5, 7, 10))` generate an `IndexError: tuple index out of range` in line 5 `elif seq[len(seq)] < x:`.
- Running the function as follows `search(0, (-5, -1, 3, 5, 7, 10))` generate an `IndexError: tuple index out of range` in line 5 `elif seq[len(seq)] < x:`.
- Running the function as follows `search(100, [])` yields `None` instead of the expected `0`.
- Running the function as follows `search(-100, ())` yields `None` instead of the expected `0`.

Spectrum-based Fault Localization (SBFL) Techniques Results:
We have used SBFL techniques to identify potentially faulty lines. Here are the results of top-5 suspicious lines sorted in descending order of the score:
1. Line 2 `for i in range(len(seq)):`, Ochiai score: 0.538028
2. Line 3 `if seq[i] < x:`, Ochiai score: 0.486664
3. Line 4 `continue`, Ochiai score: 0.429198
4. Line 5 `elif seq[len(seq)] < x:`, Ochiai score: 0.429198
5. Line 9 `""" Takes in a value x and a sorted sequence seq, and returns the`, Ochiai score: 0.324443

Analyze the provided code and utilize task description, test results, and SBFL techniques results to help in identifying potentially faulty lines. Provide the results following this JSON template:
```json
{
  "faultLoc": [
    {
      "faultyLine": (indicating the line number of the suspicious code),
      "code": (displaying the actual code),
      "explanation": (step by step reasoning on why this location is considered potentially faulty)
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```
Ensure that the objects in the "faultLoc" array are sorted in descending order of suspicion.
