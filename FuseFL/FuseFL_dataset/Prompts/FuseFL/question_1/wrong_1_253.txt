Faulty Code:
```python
def search(x, seq):
    if seq == [] or seq == ():
        position = 0
    if x <= seq[0]:
        position = 0
    if x >= seq[len(seq) - 1]:
        position = len(seq)
    for i in range(len(seq)):
        if x <= seq[i] and x > seq[i-1]:
            position = i
    return position

```

Task Description:
The `search` function takes in a value x and a sorted sequence seq, and returns the position that x should go to such that the sequence remains sorted. If the element x is found, it should return the first posible position. If the seq is empty, it should return 0. 

Test Results:
The provided code is producing incorrect results. For example:
- Running the function as follows `search(100, [])` generate an `IndexError: list index out of range` in line 4 `if x <= seq[0]:`.
- Running the function as follows `search(-100, ())` generate an `IndexError: tuple index out of range` in line 4 `if x <= seq[0]:`.

Spectrum-based Fault Localization (SBFL) Techniques Results:
We have used SBFL techniques to identify potentially faulty lines. Here are the results of top-5 suspicious lines sorted in descending order of the score:
1. Line 3 `position = 0`, Ochiai score: 0.577350
2. Line 2 `if seq == [] or seq == ():`, Ochiai score: 0.246183
3. Line 4 `if x <= seq[0]:`, Ochiai score: 0.246183
4. Line 6 `if x >= seq[len(seq) - 1]:`, Ochiai score: 0.000000
5. Line 7 `position = len(seq)`, Ochiai score: 0.000000

Analyze the provided code and utilize task description, test results, and SBFL techniques results to help in identifying potentially faulty lines. Provide the results following this JSON template:
```json
{
  "faultLoc": [
    {
      "faultyLine": (indicating the line number of the suspicious code),
      "code": (displaying the actual code),
      "explanation": (step by step reasoning on why this location is considered potentially faulty)
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```
Ensure that the objects in the "faultLoc" array are sorted in descending order of suspicion.
