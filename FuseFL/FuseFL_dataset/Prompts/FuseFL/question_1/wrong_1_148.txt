Faulty Code:
```python
#def search(x, seq):
#    """ Takes in a value x and a sorted sequence seq, and returns the
#    position that x should go to such that the sequence remains sorted """
#    return



def search(val,seq):
    if val <= seq[0]:
        position = 0
    elif val >= seq[-1]:
        position = len(seq)
    else:
        for item in seq:
            if val <= item:
                position = seq.index(item)-1
    return position
```

Task Description:
The `search` function takes in a value x and a sorted sequence seq, and returns the position that x should go to such that the sequence remains sorted. If the element x is found, it should return the first posible position. If the seq is empty, it should return 0. 

Test Results:
The provided code is producing incorrect results. For example:
- Running the function as follows `search(7, [1, 5, 10])` yields `1` instead of the expected `2`.
- Running the function as follows `search(10, (-5, -1, 3, 5, 7, 10))` yields `6` instead of the expected `5`.
- Running the function as follows `search(0, (-5, -1, 3, 5, 7, 10))` yields `4` instead of the expected `2`.
- Running the function as follows `search(100, [])` generate an `IndexError: list index out of range` in line 9 `if val <= seq[0]:`.
- Running the function as follows `search(-100, ())` generate an `IndexError: tuple index out of range` in line 9 `if val <= seq[0]:`.

Spectrum-based Fault Localization (SBFL) Techniques Results:
We have used SBFL techniques to identify potentially faulty lines. Here are the results of top-5 suspicious lines sorted in descending order of the score:
1. Line 9 `if val <= seq[0]:`, Ochiai score: 0.355335
2. Line 11 `elif val >= seq[-1]:`, Ochiai score: 0.267261
3. Line 17 `return position`, Ochiai score: 0.235702
4. Line 14 `for item in seq:`, Ochiai score: 0.235702
5. Line 15 `if val <= item:`, Ochiai score: 0.235702

Analyze the provided code and utilize task description, test results, and SBFL techniques results to help in identifying potentially faulty lines. Provide the results following this JSON template:
```json
{
  "faultLoc": [
    {
      "faultyLine": (indicating the line number of the suspicious code),
      "code": (displaying the actual code),
      "explanation": (step by step reasoning on why this location is considered potentially faulty)
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```
Ensure that the objects in the "faultLoc" array are sorted in descending order of suspicion.
