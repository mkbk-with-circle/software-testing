Faulty Code:
```python
def search(x, seq):
    lst1 = list(seq)
    if seq == ():
        return 0
    else: 
        length = len(lst1)
        lst2 = []
        if x < seq[0]:
            lst2 = [x] + lst1
        elif x > seq[length -1]:
            lst2 = lst1 + [x]
        else:
            for i in range(0, length):
                if seq[i] <= x <= seq[i+1]:
                    lst2 = lst1[:i+1] + [x] + lst1[i+1:]
        for i in range(len(lst2)):
            if x == lst2[i]:
                return i
```

Task Description:
The `search` function takes in a value x and a sorted sequence seq, and returns the position that x should go to such that the sequence remains sorted. If the element x is found, it should return the first posible position. If the seq is empty, it should return 0. 

Test Results:
The provided code is producing incorrect results. For example:
- Running the function as follows `search(10, (-5, -1, 3, 5, 7, 10))` generate an `IndexError: tuple index out of range` in line 14 `if seq[i] <= x <= seq[i+1]:`.
- Running the function as follows `search(100, [])` generate an `IndexError: list index out of range` in line 8 `if x < seq[0]:`.

Spectrum-based Fault Localization (SBFL) Techniques Results:
We have used SBFL techniques to identify potentially faulty lines. Here are the results of top-5 suspicious lines sorted in descending order of the score:
1. Line 6 `length = len(lst1)`, Ochiai score: 0.169031
2. Line 7 `lst2 = []`, Ochiai score: 0.169031
3. Line 8 `if x < seq[0]:`, Ochiai score: 0.169031
4. Line 2 `lst1 = list(seq)`, Ochiai score: 0.161165
5. Line 3 `if seq == ():`, Ochiai score: 0.161165

Analyze the provided code and utilize task description, test results, and SBFL techniques results to help in identifying potentially faulty lines. Provide the results following this JSON template:
```json
{
  "faultLoc": [
    {
      "faultyLine": (indicating the line number of the suspicious code),
      "code": (displaying the actual code),
      "explanation": (step by step reasoning on why this location is considered potentially faulty)
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```
Ensure that the objects in the "faultLoc" array are sorted in descending order of suspicion.
