Faulty Code:
```python
def search(x, seq):
    for i, elem in enumerate(seq):
        if seq == ():
            return (i,)
        elif seq == []:
            return [i,]
        elif x <= elem:
            return i
        elif x > seq[len(seq)-1]:
            return len(seq)
```

Task Description:
The `search` function takes in a value x and a sorted sequence seq, and returns the position that x should go to such that the sequence remains sorted. If the element x is found, it should return the first posible position. If the seq is empty, it should return 0. 

Test Results:
The provided code is producing incorrect results. For example:
- Running the function as follows `search(100, [])` yields `None` instead of the expected `0`.
- Running the function as follows `search(-100, ())` yields `None` instead of the expected `0`.

Spectrum-based Fault Localization (SBFL) Techniques Results:
We have used SBFL techniques to identify potentially faulty lines. Here are the results of top-5 suspicious lines sorted in descending order of the score:
1. Line 2 `for i, elem in enumerate(seq):`, Ochiai score: 0.426401
2. Line 3 `if seq == ():`, Ochiai score: 0.000000
3. Line 5 `elif seq == []:`, Ochiai score: 0.000000
4. Line 7 `elif x <= elem:`, Ochiai score: 0.000000
5. Line 9 `elif x > seq[len(seq)-1]:`, Ochiai score: 0.000000

Analyze the provided code and utilize task description, test results, and SBFL techniques results to help in identifying potentially faulty lines. Provide the results following this JSON template:
```json
{
  "faultLoc": [
    {
      "faultyLine": (indicating the line number of the suspicious code),
      "code": (displaying the actual code),
      "explanation": (step by step reasoning on why this location is considered potentially faulty)
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```
Ensure that the objects in the "faultLoc" array are sorted in descending order of suspicion.
