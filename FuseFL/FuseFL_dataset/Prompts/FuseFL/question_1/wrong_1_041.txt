Faulty Code:
```python
def search(x, seq):
    for i in range(1, len(seq)+1):
        if x < seq[i-1]:
            return i-1
        elif seq[i-1]<x<=seq[i]:
            return i
    return i  
        
```

Task Description:
The `search` function takes in a value x and a sorted sequence seq, and returns the position that x should go to such that the sequence remains sorted. If the element x is found, it should return the first posible position. If the seq is empty, it should return 0. 

Test Results:
The provided code is producing incorrect results. For example:
- Running the function as follows `search(42, (-5, 1, 3, 5, 7, 10))` generate an `IndexError: tuple index out of range` in line 5 `elif seq[i-1]<x<=seq[i]:`.
- Running the function as follows `search(42, [1, 5, 10])` generate an `IndexError: list index out of range` in line 5 `elif seq[i-1]<x<=seq[i]:`.
- Running the function as follows `search(100, [])` generate an `UnboundLocalError: local variable 'i' referenced before assignment` in line 7 `return i`.
- Running the function as follows `search(-100, ())` generate an `UnboundLocalError: local variable 'i' referenced before assignment` in line 7 `return i`.

Spectrum-based Fault Localization (SBFL) Techniques Results:
We have used SBFL techniques to identify potentially faulty lines. Here are the results of top-5 suspicious lines sorted in descending order of the score:
1. Line 7 `return i`, Ochiai score: 0.447214
2. Line 2 `for i in range(1, len(seq)+1):`, Ochiai score: 0.381385
3. Line 5 `elif seq[i-1]<x<=seq[i]:`, Ochiai score: 0.239046
4. Line 3 `if x < seq[i-1]:`, Ochiai score: 0.210819
5. Line 6 `return i`, Ochiai score: 0.000000

Analyze the provided code and utilize task description, test results, and SBFL techniques results to help in identifying potentially faulty lines. Provide the results following this JSON template:
```json
{
  "faultLoc": [
    {
      "faultyLine": (indicating the line number of the suspicious code),
      "code": (displaying the actual code),
      "explanation": (step by step reasoning on why this location is considered potentially faulty)
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```
Ensure that the objects in the "faultLoc" array are sorted in descending order of suspicion.
