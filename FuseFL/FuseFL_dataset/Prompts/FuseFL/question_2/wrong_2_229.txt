Faulty Code:
```python
def unique_day(day, possible_birthdays):
    flat_possible_birthdays=enumerate_tree(possible_birthdays)
    if flat_possible_birthdays.count(day) == 1:
        return True
    else:
        return False

    elif is_leaf(tree):
        return (tree,)
    else:
        return enumerate_tree(tree[0])+enumerate_tree(tree[1:])
def is_leaf(item):
    return type(item) != tuple

def unique_month(month, possible_birthdays):
    flat_possible_birthdays=enumerate_tree(possible_birthdays)
    if flat_possible_birthdays.count(month) == 1:
        return True
    else:
        return False

def contains_unique_day(month, possible_birthdays):
    for each_day_in_month in filter(lambda x: x[0] == month, possible_birthdays):

Task Description:
The `unique_day` function takes a day (provided as a string) and a list of possible_birthdays (represented as tuples containing month and day) as input. It checks if a given day is unique within the list of possible birthdays.
The `unique_month` function takes a month (provided as a string) and a list of possible_birthdays (represented as tuples containing month and day) as input. It checks if a given month is unique within the list of possible birthdays.
The `contains_unique_day` function takes a month (provided as a string) and a list of possible_birthdays (represented as tuples containing month and day) as input. It checks if there exists a birthday with a unique day within the list for a specific month.

Test Results:
The provided code is producing incorrect results. For example:
- Running the function as follows `contains_unique_day("February", (("January","10"),("February","1"),("February","10")))` yields `False` instead of the expected `True`.

Spectrum-based Fault Localization (SBFL) Techniques Results:
We have used SBFL techniques to identify potentially faulty lines. Here are the results of top-5 suspicious lines sorted in descending order of the score:
1. Line 28 `res = True`, Ochiai score: 0.129099
2. Line 30 `res = False`, Ochiai score: 0.111803
3. Line 39 `return filter(pred,seq[1:])`, Ochiai score: 0.111803
4. Line 34 `if seq ==():`, Ochiai score: 0.100000
5. Line 26 `for each_day_in_month in filter(lambda x: x[0] == month, possible_birthdays):`, Ochiai score: 0.100000

Analyze the provided code and utilize task description, test results, and SBFL techniques results to help in identifying potentially faulty lines. Provide the results following this JSON template:
```json
{
  "faultLoc": [
    {
      "faultyLine": (indicating the line number of the suspicious code),
      "code": (displaying the actual code),
      "explanation": (step by step reasoning on why this location is considered potentially faulty)
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```
Ensure that the objects in the "faultLoc" array are sorted in descending order of suspicion.
