Faulty Code:
```python
def unique_day(day, possible_birthdays):
    
    tupleofdays = ()
    for i in possible_birthdays:
        tupleofdays += (i[1],)

    count = 0
    for i in tupleofdays:
        if day == i:
            count += 1

    return count == 1

def unique_month(month, possible_birthdays):
    tupleofmonths = ()
    for i in possible_birthdays:
        tupleofmonths += (i[0],)

    count = 0

    for i in tupleofmonths:
        if month == i:
            count += 1

    return count ==1

def contains_unique_day(month, possible_birthdays):
##    """Your solution here"""

    for i in possible_birthdays:
        if unique_day(i[1], possible_birthdays) == True:
            ans = False
            if i[0] == month:
                ans = True
                break
            else:
                continue
        else:
            continue

    return ans

Task Description:
The `unique_day` function takes a day (provided as a string) and a list of possible_birthdays (represented as tuples containing month and day) as input. It checks if a given day is unique within the list of possible birthdays.
The `unique_month` function takes a month (provided as a string) and a list of possible_birthdays (represented as tuples containing month and day) as input. It checks if a given month is unique within the list of possible birthdays.
The `contains_unique_day` function takes a month (provided as a string) and a list of possible_birthdays (represented as tuples containing month and day) as input. It checks if there exists a birthday with a unique day within the list for a specific month.

Test Results:
The provided code is producing incorrect results. For example:
- Running the function as follows `contains_unique_day("January", (("January","1"),("February","1")))` generate an `UnboundLocalError: local variable 'ans' referenced before assignment` in line 41 `return ans`.

Spectrum-based Fault Localization (SBFL) Techniques Results:
We have used SBFL techniques to identify potentially faulty lines. Here are the results of top-5 suspicious lines sorted in descending order of the score:
1. Line 39 `continue`, Ochiai score: 0.144338
2. Line 30 `for i in possible_birthdays:`, Ochiai score: 0.129099
3. Line 31 `if unique_day(i[1], possible_birthdays) == True:`, Ochiai score: 0.129099
4. Line 41 `return ans`, Ochiai score: 0.129099
5. Line 10 `count += 1`, Ochiai score: 0.087039

Analyze the provided code and utilize task description, test results, and SBFL techniques results to help in identifying potentially faulty lines. Provide the results following this JSON template:
```json
{
  "faultLoc": [
    {
      "faultyLine": (indicating the line number of the suspicious code),
      "code": (displaying the actual code),
      "explanation": (step by step reasoning on why this location is considered potentially faulty)
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```
Ensure that the objects in the "faultLoc" array are sorted in descending order of suspicion.
