Faulty Code:
```python
def count_dates(date, possible_birthdays):
    count = 0
    for i in possible_birthdays:
        if i[1] == date:
            count += 1
    return count

        return True
    else:
        return False

            count += 1
    return count

Task Description:
The `unique_day` function takes a day (provided as a string) and a list of possible_birthdays (represented as tuples containing month and day) as input. It checks if a given day is unique within the list of possible birthdays.
The `unique_month` function takes a month (provided as a string) and a list of possible_birthdays (represented as tuples containing month and day) as input. It checks if a given month is unique within the list of possible birthdays.
The `contains_unique_day` function takes a month (provided as a string) and a list of possible_birthdays (represented as tuples containing month and day) as input. It checks if there exists a birthday with a unique day within the list for a specific month.

Test Results:
The provided code is producing incorrect results. For example:
- Running the function as follows `contains_unique_day("January", (("January","1"),("February","1")))` yields `True` instead of the expected `False`.
- Running the function as follows `contains_unique_day("July", tuple_of_possible_birthdays)` yields `True` instead of the expected `False`.

Spectrum-based Fault Localization (SBFL) Techniques Results:
We have used SBFL techniques to identify potentially faulty lines. Here are the results of top-5 suspicious lines sorted in descending order of the score:
1. Line 35 `for x in range(len(days(month, possible_birthdays))):`, Ochiai score: 0.169031
2. Line 28 `days_in_month = ()`, Ochiai score: 0.169031
3. Line 29 `for i in possible_birthdays:`, Ochiai score: 0.169031
4. Line 30 `if i[0] == month:`, Ochiai score: 0.169031
5. Line 32 `return days_in_month`, Ochiai score: 0.169031

Analyze the provided code and utilize task description, test results, and SBFL techniques results to help in identifying potentially faulty lines. Provide the results following this JSON template:
```json
{
  "faultLoc": [
    {
      "faultyLine": (indicating the line number of the suspicious code),
      "code": (displaying the actual code),
      "explanation": (step by step reasoning on why this location is considered potentially faulty)
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```
Ensure that the objects in the "faultLoc" array are sorted in descending order of suspicion.
