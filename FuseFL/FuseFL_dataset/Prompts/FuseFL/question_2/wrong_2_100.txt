Faulty Code:
```python
def unique_day(date, possible_birthdays):
    count = 0
    for i in possible_birthdays:
        if date == i[1]:
            count += 1
        return count
    if count == 1:
        return True
    else:
        return False
    

def unique_month(month, possible_birthdays):
    return

def contains_unique_day(month, possible_birthdays):
    return 
```

Task Description:
The `unique_day` function takes a day (provided as a string) and a list of possible_birthdays (represented as tuples containing month and day) as input. It checks if a given day is unique within the list of possible birthdays.
The `unique_month` function takes a month (provided as a string) and a list of possible_birthdays (represented as tuples containing month and day) as input. It checks if a given month is unique within the list of possible birthdays.
The `contains_unique_day` function takes a month (provided as a string) and a list of possible_birthdays (represented as tuples containing month and day) as input. It checks if there exists a birthday with a unique day within the list for a specific month.

Test Results:
The provided code is producing incorrect results. For example:
- Running the function as follows `unique_day("1", (("January","1"),("February","1")))` yields `1` instead of the expected `False`.
- Running the function as follows `unique_month("January", (("January","1"),("January","2")))` yields `None` instead of the expected `False`.
- Running the function as follows `unique_month("January", (("January","1"),("February","1")))` yields `None` instead of the expected `True`.
- Running the function as follows `contains_unique_day("January", (("January","1"),("January","2")))` yields `None` instead of the expected `True`.
- Running the function as follows `contains_unique_day("January", (("January","1"),("February","1")))` yields `None` instead of the expected `False`.
- Running the function as follows `contains_unique_day("February", (("January","10"),("February","1"),("February","10")))` yields `None` instead of the expected `True`.
- Running the function as follows `unique_month("March", (("January","1"),("February","1")))` yields `None` instead of the expected `False`.
- Running the function as follows `unique_day("18", tuple_of_possible_birthdays)` yields `0` instead of the expected `True`.
- Running the function as follows `unique_day("19", tuple_of_possible_birthdays)` yields `0` instead of the expected `True`.
- Running the function as follows `unique_month("May", tuple_of_possible_birthdays)` yields `None` instead of the expected `False`.
- Running the function as follows `unique_month("June", tuple_of_possible_birthdays)` yields `None` instead of the expected `False`.
- Running the function as follows `contains_unique_day("June", tuple_of_possible_birthdays)` yields `None` instead of the expected `True`.
- Running the function as follows `contains_unique_day("July", tuple_of_possible_birthdays)` yields `None` instead of the expected `False`.

Spectrum-based Fault Localization (SBFL) Techniques Results:
We have used SBFL techniques to identify potentially faulty lines. Here are the results of top-5 suspicious lines sorted in descending order of the score:
1. Line 14 `return`, Ochiai score: 0.466252
2. Line 17 `return`, Ochiai score: 0.466252
3. Line 2 `count = 0`, Ochiai score: 0.236433
4. Line 3 `for i in possible_birthdays:`, Ochiai score: 0.236433
5. Line 4 `if date == i[1]:`, Ochiai score: 0.236433

Analyze the provided code and utilize task description, test results, and SBFL techniques results to help in identifying potentially faulty lines. Provide the results following this JSON template:
```json
{
  "faultLoc": [
    {
      "faultyLine": (indicating the line number of the suspicious code),
      "code": (displaying the actual code),
      "explanation": (step by step reasoning on why this location is considered potentially faulty)
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```
Ensure that the objects in the "faultLoc" array are sorted in descending order of suspicion.
