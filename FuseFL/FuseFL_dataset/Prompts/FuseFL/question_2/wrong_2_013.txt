Task Description:
The `unique_day` function takes a day (provided as a string) and a list of possible_birthdays (represented as tuples containing month and day) as input. It checks if a given day is unique within the list of possible birthdays.
The `unique_month` function takes a month (provided as a string) and a list of possible_birthdays (represented as tuples containing month and day) as input. It checks if a given month is unique within the list of possible birthdays.
The `contains_unique_day` function takes a month (provided as a string) and a list of possible_birthdays (represented as tuples containing month and day) as input. It checks if there exists a birthday with a unique day within the list for a specific month.

Test Results:
The provided code is producing incorrect results. For example:
- Running the function as follows `unique_day("1", (("January","1"),("February","1")))` generate a `NameError: name 'day' is not defined` in line 6 `if possible_birthdays[i][1] == day:`.
- Running the function as follows `contains_unique_day("January", (("January","1"),("January","2")))` generate a `NameError: name 'day' is not defined` in line 6 `if possible_birthdays[i][1] == day:`.
- Running the function as follows `contains_unique_day("January", (("January","1"),("February","1")))` generate a `NameError: name 'day' is not defined` in line 6 `if possible_birthdays[i][1] == day:`.
- Running the function as follows `contains_unique_day("February", (("January","10"),("February","1"),("February","10")))` generate a `NameError: name 'day' is not defined` in line 6 `if possible_birthdays[i][1] == day:`.
- Running the function as follows `unique_day("3", (("January","1"),("January","2")))` generate a `NameError: name 'day' is not defined` in line 6 `if possible_birthdays[i][1] == day:`.
- Running the function as follows `unique_day("1", (("January","1"),("January","2")))` generate a `NameError: name 'day' is not defined` in line 6 `if possible_birthdays[i][1] == day:`.
- Running the function as follows `unique_day("16", tuple_of_possible_birthdays)` generate a `NameError: name 'day' is not defined` in line 6 `if possible_birthdays[i][1] == day:`.
- Running the function as follows `unique_day("17", tuple_of_possible_birthdays)` generate a `NameError: name 'day' is not defined` in line 6 `if possible_birthdays[i][1] == day:`.
- Running the function as follows `unique_day("18", tuple_of_possible_birthdays)` generate a `NameError: name 'day' is not defined` in line 6 `if possible_birthdays[i][1] == day:`.
- Running the function as follows `unique_day("19", tuple_of_possible_birthdays)` generate a `NameError: name 'day' is not defined` in line 6 `if possible_birthdays[i][1] == day:`.
- Running the function as follows `contains_unique_day("June", tuple_of_possible_birthdays)` generate a `NameError: name 'day' is not defined` in line 6 `if possible_birthdays[i][1] == day:`.
- Running the function as follows `contains_unique_day("July", tuple_of_possible_birthdays)` generate a `NameError: name 'day' is not defined` in line 6 `if possible_birthdays[i][1] == day:`.

Spectrum-based Fault Localization (SBFL) Techniques Results:
We have used SBFL techniques to identify potentially faulty lines. Here are the results of top-5 suspicious lines sorted in descending order of the score:
1. Line 3 `days = 0`, Ochiai score: 0.426401
2. Line 5 `for i in range(len(possible_birthdays)):`, Ochiai score: 0.426401
3. Line 6 `if possible_birthdays[i][1] == day:`, Ochiai score: 0.426401
4. Line 30 `x = ()`, Ochiai score: 0.275241
5. Line 32 `for i in range(len(possible_birthdays)):`, Ochiai score: 0.275241

Analyze the provided code and utilize task description, test results, and SBFL techniques results to help in identifying potentially faulty lines. Provide the results following this JSON template:
```json
{
  "faultLoc": [
    {
      "faultyLine": (indicating the line number of the suspicious code),
      "code": (displaying the actual code),
      "explanation": (step by step reasoning on why this location is considered potentially faulty)
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```
Ensure that the objects in the "faultLoc" array are sorted in descending order of suspicion.
