Faulty Code:
```python
def unique_day(day, possible_birthdays):
    counter = 0
    for i in possible_birthdays:
        if str(day) == i[1]:
            counter = counter + 1
    if counter > 1:
        return False
    else:
        return True

def unique_month(month, possible_birthdays):
    counter = 0
    for i in possible_birthdays:
        if str(month) == i[0]:
            counter = counter + 1
    if counter > 1:
        return False
    else:
        return True

def contains_unique_day(month, possible_birthdays):
    list_d = ()
    for i in range(16,20):
        i_string = str(i)
        if unique_day(i_string, possible_birthdays) is True:
            list_d = list_d + (str(i),)
    for i in possible_birthdays:
        for j in list_d:
            if i[1] == j:
                if i[0] == month:
                    return True
    return False
```

Task Description:
The `unique_day` function takes a day (provided as a string) and a list of possible_birthdays (represented as tuples containing month and day) as input. It checks if a given day is unique within the list of possible birthdays.
The `unique_month` function takes a month (provided as a string) and a list of possible_birthdays (represented as tuples containing month and day) as input. It checks if a given month is unique within the list of possible birthdays.
The `contains_unique_day` function takes a month (provided as a string) and a list of possible_birthdays (represented as tuples containing month and day) as input. It checks if there exists a birthday with a unique day within the list for a specific month.

Test Results:
The provided code is producing incorrect results. For example:
- Running the function as follows `contains_unique_day("January", (("January","1"),("January","2")))` yields `False` instead of the expected `True`.
- Running the function as follows `contains_unique_day("February", (("January","10"),("February","1"),("February","10")))` yields `False` instead of the expected `True`.
- Running the function as follows `unique_day("3", (("January","1"),("January","2")))` yields `True` instead of the expected `False`.
- Running the function as follows `unique_month("March", (("January","1"),("February","1")))` yields `True` instead of the expected `False`.

Spectrum-based Fault Localization (SBFL) Techniques Results:
We have used SBFL techniques to identify potentially faulty lines. Here are the results of top-5 suspicious lines sorted in descending order of the score:
1. Line 9 `return True`, Ochiai score: 0.162221
2. Line 32 `return False`, Ochiai score: 0.162221
3. Line 22 `list_d = ()`, Ochiai score: 0.145095
4. Line 23 `for i in range(16,20):`, Ochiai score: 0.145095
5. Line 24 `i_string = str(i)`, Ochiai score: 0.145095

Analyze the provided code and utilize task description, test results, and SBFL techniques results to help in identifying potentially faulty lines. Provide the results following this JSON template:
```json
{
  "faultLoc": [
    {
      "faultyLine": (indicating the line number of the suspicious code),
      "code": (displaying the actual code),
      "explanation": (step by step reasoning on why this location is considered potentially faulty)
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```
Ensure that the objects in the "faultLoc" array are sorted in descending order of suspicion.
