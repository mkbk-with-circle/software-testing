Task Description:
The `unique_day` function takes a day (provided as a string) and a list of possible_birthdays (represented as tuples containing month and day) as input. It checks if a given day is unique within the list of possible birthdays.
The `unique_month` function takes a month (provided as a string) and a list of possible_birthdays (represented as tuples containing month and day) as input. It checks if a given month is unique within the list of possible birthdays.
The `contains_unique_day` function takes a month (provided as a string) and a list of possible_birthdays (represented as tuples containing month and day) as input. It checks if there exists a birthday with a unique day within the list for a specific month.

Test Results:
The provided code is producing incorrect results. For example:
- Running the function as follows `contains_unique_day("January", (("January","1"),("January","2")))` generate an `UnboundLocalError: local variable 'found_repeated' referenced before assignment` in line 112 `if found_repeated == 0:`.
- Running the function as follows `contains_unique_day("January", (("January","1"),("February","1")))` generate an `UnboundLocalError: local variable 'found_repeated' referenced before assignment` in line 112 `if found_repeated == 0:`.
- Running the function as follows `contains_unique_day("February", (("January","10"),("February","1"),("February","10")))` generate an `UnboundLocalError: local variable 'found_repeated' referenced before assignment` in line 112 `if found_repeated == 0:`.

Spectrum-based Fault Localization (SBFL) Techniques Results:
We have used SBFL techniques to identify potentially faulty lines. Here are the results of top-5 suspicious lines sorted in descending order of the score:
1. Line 96 `for days in August_days:`, Ochiai score: 0.235702
2. Line 78 `elif month == 'July':`, Ochiai score: 0.204124
3. Line 28 `May_days = ()`, Ochiai score: 0.182574
4. Line 29 `June_days = ()`, Ochiai score: 0.182574
5. Line 30 `July_days = ()`, Ochiai score: 0.182574

Analyze the provided code and utilize task description, test results, and SBFL techniques results to help in identifying potentially faulty lines. Provide the results following this JSON template:
```json
{
  "faultLoc": [
    {
      "faultyLine": (indicating the line number of the suspicious code),
      "code": (displaying the actual code),
      "explanation": (step by step reasoning on why this location is considered potentially faulty)
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```
Ensure that the objects in the "faultLoc" array are sorted in descending order of suspicion.
