Faulty Code:
```python
def unique_day(date, possible_birthdays):

    count =0

    for i in possible_birthdays:

        if date==i[1]:

            count+=1

    return count==1

def unique_month(month, possible_birthdays):

    count =0

    for i in possible_birthdays:

        if month==i[0]:

            count+=1

    return count==1

def contains_unique_day(month, possible_birthdays):

    daysinmonth=()

    count=0

    for i in possible_birthdays:

        if month==i[0]:

            daysinmonth+=(i[1],)

    for i in daysinmonth:

        if unique_day(i,possible_birthdays):
            count+=1

    return count==1
```

Task Description:
The `unique_day` function takes a day (provided as a string) and a list of possible_birthdays (represented as tuples containing month and day) as input. It checks if a given day is unique within the list of possible birthdays.
The `unique_month` function takes a month (provided as a string) and a list of possible_birthdays (represented as tuples containing month and day) as input. It checks if a given month is unique within the list of possible birthdays.
The `contains_unique_day` function takes a month (provided as a string) and a list of possible_birthdays (represented as tuples containing month and day) as input. It checks if there exists a birthday with a unique day within the list for a specific month.

Test Results:
The provided code is producing incorrect results. For example:
- Running the function as follows `contains_unique_day("January", (("January","1"),("January","2")))` yields `False` instead of the expected `True`.

Spectrum-based Fault Localization (SBFL) Techniques Results:
We have used SBFL techniques to identify potentially faulty lines. Here are the results of top-5 suspicious lines sorted in descending order of the score:
1. Line 40 `count+=1`, Ochiai score: 0.154303
2. Line 27 `daysinmonth=()`, Ochiai score: 0.119523
3. Line 29 `count=0`, Ochiai score: 0.119523
4. Line 31 `for i in possible_birthdays:`, Ochiai score: 0.119523
5. Line 33 `if month==i[0]:`, Ochiai score: 0.119523

Analyze the provided code and utilize task description, test results, and SBFL techniques results to help in identifying potentially faulty lines. Provide the results following this JSON template:
```json
{
  "faultLoc": [
    {
      "faultyLine": (indicating the line number of the suspicious code),
      "code": (displaying the actual code),
      "explanation": (step by step reasoning on why this location is considered potentially faulty)
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```
Ensure that the objects in the "faultLoc" array are sorted in descending order of suspicion.
