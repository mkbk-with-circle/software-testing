Faulty Code:
```python
def unique_day(day, possible_birthdays):
    counter = 0
    for i in possible_birthdays:
        if day == i[1]:
            counter += 1
    if counter == 1:
        return True
    else:
        return False

def unique_month(month, possible_birthdays):
    counter = 0
    for i in possible_birthdays:
        if month == i[0]:
            counter += 1
    if counter == 1:
        return True
    else:
        return False

def contains_unique_day(month, possible_birthdays):
    focus = ()
    unique_days = ()
    for i in possible_birthdays:
        if month == i[0]:
            focus += (i,)
    for j in focus:
        testday = j[1]
        if unique_day(testday, possible_birthdays) == True:
            unique_days += (testday,)
    for k in unique_days:
        for l in focus:
            if k == l[1]:
                break
            return True
    return False
```

Task Description:
The `unique_day` function takes a day (provided as a string) and a list of possible_birthdays (represented as tuples containing month and day) as input. It checks if a given day is unique within the list of possible birthdays.
The `unique_month` function takes a month (provided as a string) and a list of possible_birthdays (represented as tuples containing month and day) as input. It checks if a given month is unique within the list of possible birthdays.
The `contains_unique_day` function takes a month (provided as a string) and a list of possible_birthdays (represented as tuples containing month and day) as input. It checks if there exists a birthday with a unique day within the list for a specific month.

Test Results:
The provided code is producing incorrect results. For example:
- Running the function as follows `contains_unique_day("February", (("January","10"),("February","1"),("February","10")))` yields `False` instead of the expected `True`.

Spectrum-based Fault Localization (SBFL) Techniques Results:
We have used SBFL techniques to identify potentially faulty lines. Here are the results of top-5 suspicious lines sorted in descending order of the score:
1. Line 34 `break`, Ochiai score: 0.154303
2. Line 30 `unique_days += (testday,)`, Ochiai score: 0.125988
3. Line 32 `for l in focus:`, Ochiai score: 0.125988
4. Line 33 `if k == l[1]:`, Ochiai score: 0.125988
5. Line 36 `return False`, Ochiai score: 0.125988

Analyze the provided code and utilize task description, test results, and SBFL techniques results to help in identifying potentially faulty lines. Provide the results following this JSON template:
```json
{
  "faultLoc": [
    {
      "faultyLine": (indicating the line number of the suspicious code),
      "code": (displaying the actual code),
      "explanation": (step by step reasoning on why this location is considered potentially faulty)
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```
Ensure that the objects in the "faultLoc" array are sorted in descending order of suspicion.
