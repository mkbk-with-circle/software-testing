Faulty Code:
```python
def unique_day(day, possible_birthdays):
    count = 0
    for birthdays in possible_birthdays:
        if birthdays[1] == day:
            count +=1
            if count == 2:
                return False
    return True

def unique_month(month, possible_birthdays):
    count = 0
    for birthdays in possible_birthdays:
        if birthdays[0] == month:
            count +=1
            if count == 2:
                return False
    return True

def contains_unique_day(month, possible_birthdays):
    count = ()
    for birthdays in possible_birthdays:
        if birthdays[0] == month:
            count += (birthdays,)
    for sub_birthday in count:
        if unique_day(sub_birthday[1], possible_birthdays):
            return True
    return False 
```

Task Description:
The `unique_day` function takes a day (provided as a string) and a list of possible_birthdays (represented as tuples containing month and day) as input. It checks if a given day is unique within the list of possible birthdays.
The `unique_month` function takes a month (provided as a string) and a list of possible_birthdays (represented as tuples containing month and day) as input. It checks if a given month is unique within the list of possible birthdays.
The `contains_unique_day` function takes a month (provided as a string) and a list of possible_birthdays (represented as tuples containing month and day) as input. It checks if there exists a birthday with a unique day within the list for a specific month.

Test Results:
The provided code is producing incorrect results. For example:
- Running the function as follows `unique_day("3", (("January","1"),("January","2")))` yields `True` instead of the expected `False`.
- Running the function as follows `unique_month("March", (("January","1"),("February","1")))` yields `True` instead of the expected `False`.

Spectrum-based Fault Localization (SBFL) Techniques Results:
We have used SBFL techniques to identify potentially faulty lines. Here are the results of top-5 suspicious lines sorted in descending order of the score:
1. Line 17 `return True`, Ochiai score: 0.250000
2. Line 11 `count = 0`, Ochiai score: 0.158114
3. Line 12 `for birthdays in possible_birthdays:`, Ochiai score: 0.158114
4. Line 13 `if birthdays[0] == month:`, Ochiai score: 0.158114
5. Line 8 `return True`, Ochiai score: 0.133631

Analyze the provided code and utilize task description, test results, and SBFL techniques results to help in identifying potentially faulty lines. Provide the results following this JSON template:
```json
{
  "faultLoc": [
    {
      "faultyLine": (indicating the line number of the suspicious code),
      "code": (displaying the actual code),
      "explanation": (step by step reasoning on why this location is considered potentially faulty)
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```
Ensure that the objects in the "faultLoc" array are sorted in descending order of suspicion.
