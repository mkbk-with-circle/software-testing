Faulty Code:
```python
def unique_day(day, possible_birthdays):
    count = 0
    for month_day in possible_birthdays:
        date = month_day[1]
        if day == date:
            count+= 1
    return count == 1

def unique_month(month, possible_birthdays):
    count = 0
    for month_day in possible_birthdays:
        mont = month_day[0]
        if month == mont:
            count+= 1
    return count == 1

def contains_unique_day(month, possible_birthdays):
    condition = False
    for month_day in possible_birthdays:
        if month == month_day[0]:
            condition = unique_day(month_day[1],possible_birthdays)
    return condition
```

Task Description:
The `unique_day` function takes a day (provided as a string) and a list of possible_birthdays (represented as tuples containing month and day) as input. It checks if a given day is unique within the list of possible birthdays.
The `unique_month` function takes a month (provided as a string) and a list of possible_birthdays (represented as tuples containing month and day) as input. It checks if a given month is unique within the list of possible birthdays.
The `contains_unique_day` function takes a month (provided as a string) and a list of possible_birthdays (represented as tuples containing month and day) as input. It checks if there exists a birthday with a unique day within the list for a specific month.

Test Results:
The provided code is producing incorrect results. For example:
- Running the function as follows `contains_unique_day("February", (("January","10"),("February","1"),("February","10")))` yields `False` instead of the expected `True`.

Spectrum-based Fault Localization (SBFL) Techniques Results:
We have used SBFL techniques to identify potentially faulty lines. Here are the results of top-5 suspicious lines sorted in descending order of the score:
1. Line 18 `condition = False`, Ochiai score: 0.134840
2. Line 19 `for month_day in possible_birthdays:`, Ochiai score: 0.134840
3. Line 20 `if month == month_day[0]:`, Ochiai score: 0.134840
4. Line 22 `return condition`, Ochiai score: 0.134840
5. Line 21 `condition = unique_day(month_day[1],possible_birthdays)`, Ochiai score: 0.134840

Analyze the provided code and utilize task description, test results, and SBFL techniques results to help in identifying potentially faulty lines. Provide the results following this JSON template:
```json
{
  "faultLoc": [
    {
      "faultyLine": (indicating the line number of the suspicious code),
      "code": (displaying the actual code),
      "explanation": (step by step reasoning on why this location is considered potentially faulty)
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```
Ensure that the objects in the "faultLoc" array are sorted in descending order of suspicion.
