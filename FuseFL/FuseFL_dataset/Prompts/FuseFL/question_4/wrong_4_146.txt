Faulty Code:
```python
def sort_age(lst):
    youngest = lst[0][1]
    sorted = []
    while lst:
        for elem in lst:
            if elem[1] < youngest:
                youngest = elem[1]
        lst.remove(youngest)
        sorted.append(youngest)
    return sorted
```

Task Description:
Given a list of people that is represented using a tuple (<gender>, <age>), function `sort_age` sorts the people and return a list in an order such that the older people are at the front of the list. An example of the list of people is [("M", 23), ("F", 19), ("M", 30)]. The sorted list would look like [("M", 30), ("M", 23), ("F", 19)]. You may assume that no two members of the list of people are of the same age.


Test Results:
The provided code is producing incorrect results. For example:
- Running the function as follows `sort_age([("F", 19)])` generate a `ValueError: list.remove(x): x not in list` in line 8 `lst.remove(youngest)`.
- Running the function as follows `sort_age([("M", 35), ("F", 18), ("M", 23), ("F", 19), ("M", 30), ("M", 17)])` generate a `ValueError: list.remove(x): x not in list` in line 8 `lst.remove(youngest)`.
- Running the function as follows `sort_age([("F", 18), ("M", 23), ("F", 19), ("M", 30), ("M", 17)])` generate a `ValueError: list.remove(x): x not in list` in line 8 `lst.remove(youngest)`.
- Running the function as follows `sort_age([("F", 18), ("M", 23), ("F", 19), ("M", 30)])` generate a `ValueError: list.remove(x): x not in list` in line 8 `lst.remove(youngest)`.
- Running the function as follows `sort_age([("M", 23), ("F", 19), ("M", 30)])` generate a `ValueError: list.remove(x): x not in list` in line 8 `lst.remove(youngest)`.
- Running the function as follows `sort_age([])` generate an `IndexError: list index out of range` in line 2 `youngest = lst[0][1]`.

Spectrum-based Fault Localization (SBFL) Techniques Results:
We have used SBFL techniques to identify potentially faulty lines. Here are the results of top-5 suspicious lines sorted in descending order of the score:
1. Line 2 `youngest = lst[0][1]`, Ochiai score: 0.420084
2. Line 3 `sorted = []`, Ochiai score: 0.383482
3. Line 4 `while lst:`, Ochiai score: 0.383482
4. Line 5 `for elem in lst:`, Ochiai score: 0.383482
5. Line 6 `if elem[1] < youngest:`, Ochiai score: 0.383482

Analyze the provided code and utilize task description, test results, and SBFL techniques results to help in identifying potentially faulty lines. Provide the results following this JSON template:
```json
{
  "faultLoc": [
    {
      "faultyLine": (indicating the line number of the suspicious code),
      "code": (displaying the actual code),
      "explanation": (step by step reasoning on why this location is considered potentially faulty)
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```
Ensure that the objects in the "faultLoc" array are sorted in descending order of suspicion.
