Faulty Code:
```python
def sort_age(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst-1)):
        for j in range(len(lst)-1-i):
            if lst[j][1] < lst[j+1][1]:
                lst[j][1],lst[j+1][1] = lst[j+1][1],lst[j][1]
            else:
                continue
    return lst    
    pass
```

Task Description:
Given a list of people that is represented using a tuple (<gender>, <age>), function `sort_age` sorts the people and return a list in an order such that the older people are at the front of the list. An example of the list of people is [("M", 23), ("F", 19), ("M", 30)]. The sorted list would look like [("M", 30), ("M", 23), ("F", 19)]. You may assume that no two members of the list of people are of the same age.


Test Results:
The provided code is producing incorrect results. For example:
- Running the function as follows `sort_age([("F", 19)])` generate a `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'list' and 'int'` in line 2 `for i in range(len(lst-1)):`.
- Running the function as follows `sort_age([("M", 35), ("F", 18), ("M", 23), ("F", 19), ("M", 30), ("M", 17)])` generate a `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'list' and 'int'` in line 2 `for i in range(len(lst-1)):`.
- Running the function as follows `sort_age([("F", 18), ("M", 23), ("F", 19), ("M", 30), ("M", 17)])` generate a `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'list' and 'int'` in line 2 `for i in range(len(lst-1)):`.
- Running the function as follows `sort_age([("F", 18), ("M", 23), ("F", 19), ("M", 30)])` generate a `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'list' and 'int'` in line 2 `for i in range(len(lst-1)):`.
- Running the function as follows `sort_age([("M", 23), ("F", 19), ("M", 30)])` generate a `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'list' and 'int'` in line 2 `for i in range(len(lst-1)):`.
- Running the function as follows `sort_age([])` generate a `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'list' and 'int'` in line 2 `for i in range(len(lst-1)):`.

Spectrum-based Fault Localization (SBFL) Techniques Results:
We have used SBFL techniques to identify potentially faulty lines. Here are the results of top-1 suspicious lines sorted in descending order of the score:
1. Line 2 `for i in range(len(lst-1)):`, Ochiai score: 1.000000

Analyze the provided code and utilize task description, test results, and SBFL techniques results to help in identifying potentially faulty lines. Provide the results following this JSON template:
```json
{
  "faultLoc": [
    {
      "faultyLine": (indicating the line number of the suspicious code),
      "code": (displaying the actual code),
      "explanation": (step by step reasoning on why this location is considered potentially faulty)
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```
Ensure that the objects in the "faultLoc" array are sorted in descending order of suspicion.
