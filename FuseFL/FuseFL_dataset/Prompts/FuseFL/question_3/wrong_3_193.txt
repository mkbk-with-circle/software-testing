Faulty Code:
```python
def remove_extras(lst):
    count=0
    rev_lst=lst.reverse()
    ori_len=len(lst)
    new_lst=lst.copy()
    for i in range(ori_len):
        if rev_lst[i] in rev_lst[i+1:]:
            new_lst.pop(ori_len-i-1)
    return new_lst
```

Task Description:
The function `remove_extras` takes in a list and returns a new list with all repeated occurrences of any element removed. This new list should maintain the same order as the input list. For example, remove_extras([5, 2, 1, 2, 3]) returns the list [5, 2, 1, 3].

Test Results:
The provided code is producing incorrect results. For example:
- Running the function as follows `remove_extras([1, 1, 1, 2, 3])` generate a `TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable` in line 7 `if rev_lst[i] in rev_lst[i+1:]:`.
- Running the function as follows `remove_extras([1, 5, 1, 1, 3, 2])` generate a `TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable` in line 7 `if rev_lst[i] in rev_lst[i+1:]:`.
- Running the function as follows `remove_extras([3, 4, 5, 1, 3])` generate a `TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable` in line 7 `if rev_lst[i] in rev_lst[i+1:]:`.
- Running the function as follows `remove_extras([3, 4, 5, 1, 3])` generate a `TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable` in line 7 `if rev_lst[i] in rev_lst[i+1:]:`.
- Running the function as follows `remove_extras([3, 4, 5, 1, 3])` generate a `TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable` in line 7 `if rev_lst[i] in rev_lst[i+1:]:`.

Spectrum-based Fault Localization (SBFL) Techniques Results:
We have used SBFL techniques to identify potentially faulty lines. Here are the results of top-5 suspicious lines sorted in descending order of the score:
1. Line 7 `if rev_lst[i] in rev_lst[i+1:]:`, Ochiai score: 0.408248
2. Line 2 `count=0`, Ochiai score: 0.372678
3. Line 3 `rev_lst=lst.reverse()`, Ochiai score: 0.372678
4. Line 4 `ori_len=len(lst)`, Ochiai score: 0.372678
5. Line 5 `new_lst=lst.copy()`, Ochiai score: 0.372678

Analyze the provided code and utilize task description, test results, and SBFL techniques results to help in identifying potentially faulty lines. Provide the results following this JSON template:
```json
{
  "faultLoc": [
    {
      "faultyLine": (indicating the line number of the suspicious code),
      "code": (displaying the actual code),
      "explanation": (step by step reasoning on why this location is considered potentially faulty)
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```
Ensure that the objects in the "faultLoc" array are sorted in descending order of suspicion.
