Faulty Code:
```python
def remove_extras(lst):
    lst.sort()
    i = 1
    n = len(lst)
    while i < n:
        if lst[i]==lst[i-1]:
            lst.remove(lst[i])
        else:
            i += 1
        n = len(lst)
    return lst
    pass
```

Task Description:
The function `remove_extras` takes in a list and returns a new list with all repeated occurrences of any element removed. This new list should maintain the same order as the input list. For example, remove_extras([5, 2, 1, 2, 3]) returns the list [5, 2, 1, 3].

Test Results:
The provided code is producing incorrect results. For example:
- Running the function as follows `remove_extras([1, 5, 1, 1, 3, 2])` yields `[1, 2, 3, 5]` instead of the expected `[1, 5, 3, 2]`.
- Running the function as follows `remove_extras([3, 4, 5, 1, 3])` yields `[1, 3, 4, 5]` instead of the expected `[3, 4, 5, 1]`.
- Running the function as follows `remove_extras([3, 4, 5, 1, 3])` yields `[1, 3, 4, 5]` instead of the expected `[3, 4, 5, 1]`.
- Running the function as follows `remove_extras([3, 4, 5, 1, 3])` yields `[1, 3, 4, 5]` instead of the expected `[3, 4, 5, 1]`.

Spectrum-based Fault Localization (SBFL) Techniques Results:
We have used SBFL techniques to identify potentially faulty lines. Here are the results of top-5 suspicious lines sorted in descending order of the score:
1. Line 6 `if lst[i]==lst[i-1]:`, Ochiai score: 0.298142
2. Line 7 `lst.remove(lst[i])`, Ochiai score: 0.298142
3. Line 9 `i += 1`, Ochiai score: 0.298142
4. Line 10 `n = len(lst)`, Ochiai score: 0.298142
5. Line 2 `lst.sort()`, Ochiai score: 0.272166

Analyze the provided code and utilize task description, test results, and SBFL techniques results to help in identifying potentially faulty lines. Provide the results following this JSON template:
```json
{
  "faultLoc": [
    {
      "faultyLine": (indicating the line number of the suspicious code),
      "code": (displaying the actual code),
      "explanation": (step by step reasoning on why this location is considered potentially faulty)
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```
Ensure that the objects in the "faultLoc" array are sorted in descending order of suspicion.
