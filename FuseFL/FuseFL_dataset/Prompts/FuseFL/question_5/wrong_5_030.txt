Faulty Code:
```python
def top_k(lst, k):
    sort, output = [], []
    while lst:
        largest = lst[0]
        for i in lst:
            if i > largest:
                largest = i
        lst.remove(largest)
        sort.append(largest)
    for j in sort:
        output.append(j)
        if len(output) == k:
            break
    return output    
```

Task Description:
The `top_k` function takes in a list of integers as the input and returns the greatest k number of values as a list, with its elements sorted in descending order. 

Test Results:
The provided code is producing incorrect results. For example:
- Running the function as follows `top_k([4, 5, 2, 3, 1, 6], 0)` yields `[6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]` instead of the expected `[]`.

Spectrum-based Fault Localization (SBFL) Techniques Results:
We have used SBFL techniques to identify potentially faulty lines. Here are the results of top-5 suspicious lines sorted in descending order of the score:
1. Line 2 `sort, output = [], []`, Ochiai score: 0.129099
2. Line 3 `while lst:`, Ochiai score: 0.129099
3. Line 4 `largest = lst[0]`, Ochiai score: 0.129099
4. Line 10 `for j in sort:`, Ochiai score: 0.129099
5. Line 5 `for i in lst:`, Ochiai score: 0.129099

Analyze the provided code and utilize task description, test results, and SBFL techniques results to help in identifying potentially faulty lines. Provide the results following this JSON template:
```json
{
  "faultLoc": [
    {
      "faultyLine": (indicating the line number of the suspicious code),
      "code": (displaying the actual code),
      "explanation": (step by step reasoning on why this location is considered potentially faulty)
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```
Ensure that the objects in the "faultLoc" array are sorted in descending order of suspicion.
