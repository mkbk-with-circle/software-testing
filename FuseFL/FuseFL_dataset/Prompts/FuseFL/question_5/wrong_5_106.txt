Faulty Code:
```python
def top_k(lst, k):
    new = []
    lst.sort()
    for i in range(k-1):
        new.append(lst[i])
    return new
```

Task Description:
The `top_k` function takes in a list of integers as the input and returns the greatest k number of values as a list, with its elements sorted in descending order. 

Test Results:
The provided code is producing incorrect results. For example:
- Running the function as follows `top_k([9, 9, 4, 9, 7, 9, 3, 1, 6], 5)` yields `[1, 3, 4, 6]` instead of the expected `[9, 9, 9, 9, 7]`.
- Running the function as follows `top_k([9, 8, 4, 5, 7, 2, 3, 1, 6], 5)` yields `[1, 2, 3, 4]` instead of the expected `[9, 8, 7, 6, 5]`.
- Running the function as follows `top_k([4, 5, 2, 3, 1, 6], 6)` yields `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` instead of the expected `[6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`.
- Running the function as follows `top_k([4, 5, 2, 3, 1, 6], 3)` yields `[1, 2]` instead of the expected `[6, 5, 4]`.

Spectrum-based Fault Localization (SBFL) Techniques Results:
We have used SBFL techniques to identify potentially faulty lines. Here are the results of top-5 suspicious lines sorted in descending order of the score:
1. Line 5 `new.append(lst[i])`, Ochiai score: 0.447214
2. Line 2 `new = []`, Ochiai score: 0.400000
3. Line 3 `lst.sort()`, Ochiai score: 0.400000
4. Line 4 `for i in range(k-1):`, Ochiai score: 0.400000
5. Line 6 `return new`, Ochiai score: 0.400000

Analyze the provided code and utilize task description, test results, and SBFL techniques results to help in identifying potentially faulty lines. Provide the results following this JSON template:
```json
{
  "faultLoc": [
    {
      "faultyLine": (indicating the line number of the suspicious code),
      "code": (displaying the actual code),
      "explanation": (step by step reasoning on why this location is considered potentially faulty)
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```
Ensure that the objects in the "faultLoc" array are sorted in descending order of suspicion.
