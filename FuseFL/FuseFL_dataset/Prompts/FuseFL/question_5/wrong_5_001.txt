Faulty Code:
```python
def top_k(lst, k):
    result = []
    while k >= 0:
        big = max(lst)
        result.append(big)
        lst.remove(big)
        k -= 1
    return result
```

Task Description:
The `top_k` function takes in a list of integers as the input and returns the greatest k number of values as a list, with its elements sorted in descending order. 

Test Results:
The provided code is producing incorrect results. For example:
- Running the function as follows `top_k([9, 9, 4, 9, 7, 9, 3, 1, 6], 5)` yields `[9, 9, 9, 9, 7, 6]` instead of the expected `[9, 9, 9, 9, 7]`.
- Running the function as follows `top_k([9, 8, 4, 5, 7, 2, 3, 1, 6], 5)` yields `[9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4]` instead of the expected `[9, 8, 7, 6, 5]`.
- Running the function as follows `top_k([4, 5, 2, 3, 1, 6], 6)` generate a `ValueError: max() arg is an empty sequence` in line 4 `big = max(lst)`.
- Running the function as follows `top_k([4, 5, 2, 3, 1, 6], 3)` yields `[6, 5, 4, 3]` instead of the expected `[6, 5, 4]`.
- Running the function as follows `top_k([4, 5, 2, 3, 1, 6], 0)` yields `[6]` instead of the expected `[]`.

Spectrum-based Fault Localization (SBFL) Techniques Results:
We have used SBFL techniques to identify potentially faulty lines. Here are the results of top-5 suspicious lines sorted in descending order of the score:
1. Line 2 `result = []`, Ochiai score: 0.383482
2. Line 3 `while k >= 0:`, Ochiai score: 0.383482
3. Line 4 `big = max(lst)`, Ochiai score: 0.383482
4. Line 5 `result.append(big)`, Ochiai score: 0.383482
5. Line 6 `lst.remove(big)`, Ochiai score: 0.383482

Analyze the provided code and utilize task description, test results, and SBFL techniques results to help in identifying potentially faulty lines. Provide the results following this JSON template:
```json
{
  "faultLoc": [
    {
      "faultyLine": (indicating the line number of the suspicious code),
      "code": (displaying the actual code),
      "explanation": (step by step reasoning on why this location is considered potentially faulty)
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```
Ensure that the objects in the "faultLoc" array are sorted in descending order of suspicion.
