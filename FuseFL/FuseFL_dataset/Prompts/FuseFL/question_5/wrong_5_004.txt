Faulty Code:
```python
def top_k(lst, k):
    sort = []
    while lst: 
        biggest = lst[0]
        for element in lst:
            if ele > biggest:
                biggest = ele
                
        lst.remove(element)
        sort.append(element)
        if len(sort)==k:
            break
    return sort
```

Task Description:
The `top_k` function takes in a list of integers as the input and returns the greatest k number of values as a list, with its elements sorted in descending order. 

Test Results:
The provided code is producing incorrect results. For example:
- Running the function as follows `top_k([9, 9, 4, 9, 7, 9, 3, 1, 6], 5)` generate a `NameError: name 'ele' is not defined` in line 6 `if ele`.
- Running the function as follows `top_k([9, 8, 4, 5, 7, 2, 3, 1, 6], 5)` generate a `NameError: name 'ele' is not defined` in line 6 `if ele`.
- Running the function as follows `top_k([4, 5, 2, 3, 1, 6], 6)` generate a `NameError: name 'ele' is not defined` in line 6 `if ele`.
- Running the function as follows `top_k([4, 5, 2, 3, 1, 6], 3)` generate a `NameError: name 'ele' is not defined` in line 6 `if ele`.
- Running the function as follows `top_k([4, 5, 2, 3, 1, 6], 0)` generate a `NameError: name 'ele' is not defined` in line 6 `if ele`.

Spectrum-based Fault Localization (SBFL) Techniques Results:
We have used SBFL techniques to identify potentially faulty lines. Here are the results of top-5 suspicious lines sorted in descending order of the score:
1. Line 2 `sort = []`, Ochiai score: 0.447214
2. Line 3 `while lst:`, Ochiai score: 0.447214
3. Line 4 `biggest = lst[0]`, Ochiai score: 0.447214
4. Line 5 `for element in lst:`, Ochiai score: 0.447214
5. Line 6 `if ele > biggest:`, Ochiai score: 0.447214

Analyze the provided code and utilize task description, test results, and SBFL techniques results to help in identifying potentially faulty lines. Provide the results following this JSON template:
```json
{
  "faultLoc": [
    {
      "faultyLine": (indicating the line number of the suspicious code),
      "code": (displaying the actual code),
      "explanation": (step by step reasoning on why this location is considered potentially faulty)
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```
Ensure that the objects in the "faultLoc" array are sorted in descending order of suspicion.
