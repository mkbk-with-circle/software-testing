Faulty Code:
```python
def top_k(lst, k):
    final = []
    while lst:
        element = max(lst)
        final += [element,]
        lst.remove(element)
        if len(final) == k:
            break
    return final
```

Task Description:
The `top_k` function takes in a list of integers as the input and returns the greatest k number of values as a list, with its elements sorted in descending order. 

Test Results:
The provided code is producing incorrect results. For example:
- Running the function as follows `top_k([4, 5, 2, 3, 1, 6], 0)` yields `[6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]` instead of the expected `[]`.

Spectrum-based Fault Localization (SBFL) Techniques Results:
We have used SBFL techniques to identify potentially faulty lines. Here are the results of top-5 suspicious lines sorted in descending order of the score:
1. Line 2 `final = []`, Ochiai score: 0.169031
2. Line 3 `while lst:`, Ochiai score: 0.169031
3. Line 4 `element = max(lst)`, Ochiai score: 0.169031
4. Line 5 `final += [element,]`, Ochiai score: 0.169031
5. Line 6 `lst.remove(element)`, Ochiai score: 0.169031

Analyze the provided code and utilize task description, test results, and SBFL techniques results to help in identifying potentially faulty lines. Provide the results following this JSON template:
```json
{
  "faultLoc": [
    {
      "faultyLine": (indicating the line number of the suspicious code),
      "code": (displaying the actual code),
      "explanation": (step by step reasoning on why this location is considered potentially faulty)
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```
Ensure that the objects in the "faultLoc" array are sorted in descending order of suspicion.
