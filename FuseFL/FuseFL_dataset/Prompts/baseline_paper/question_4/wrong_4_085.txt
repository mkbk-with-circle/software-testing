Please analyse the following code snippet for potential bugs. Return the results in JSON format, consisting of a single JSON object with two fields: “intentOfThisFunction” (describing the intended purpose of the function), and “faultLocalization” (an array of JSON objects). The “faultLocalization” array should contain up to five JSON objects, each with three fields: “lineNumber” (indicating the line number of the suspicious code), “codeContent” (showing the actual code), and “reason” (explaining why this location is identified as potentially faulty). Note: The codes in the “faultLocalization” array should be listed in descending order of suspicion.
def sort_age(lst):
    new_lst = []
    while lst:
        oldest = lst [0]
        for i in range(len(lst)):
            if lst[i][1] > oldest[1]:
                oldest = lst[i]
        lst.remove(oldest)
        new_lst.append(oldest)
    print(new_lst)
