The issue occurs when the domain parameter is null in the `convertDomain` method. Here's the fixed code that handles null domains:

```java
private static String convertDomain(final String domain) {
    String strippedDomain = stripDotSuffix(domain);
    return strippedDomain != null ? strippedDomain.toUpperCase() : null;
}
```

The fix makes the following changes:
1. First calls `stripDotSuffix` and stores the result
2. Only calls `toUpperCase()` if the stripped domain is not null
3. Returns null if the input domain was null

This prevents the NullPointerException while maintaining the same functionality when the domain is provided. The fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue while preserving all other behavior of the NTLM engine.

The original code was trying to call `toUpperCase()` directly on the result of `stripDotSuffix()`, which could be null. The new version safely handles null values while still performing the uppercase conversion when a domain is present.
