The issue is that the `containsElements` method is not properly checking all elements in the collection. It returns `true` as soon as it finds the first non-null element, which may not be appropriate for hashcode calculation purposes. Here's the fixed version:

```java
/**
     * Learn whether the specified Collection contains non-null elements.
     * @param coll to check
     * @return <code>true</code> if some Object was found, <code>false</code> otherwise.
     */
    private boolean containsElements(Collection<?> coll) {
        if (coll == null || coll.isEmpty()) {
            return false;
        }
        for (Object element : coll) {
            if (element != null) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
```

Key changes made:
1. Changed `coll.size() == 0` to the more idiomatic `coll.isEmpty()`
2. Simplified the iteration using enhanced for loop
3. The logic remains the same as it correctly returns true if any non-null element is found

The original code was actually correct in its logic, so the hashcode mismatch must be coming from elsewhere in the implementation. The test failure suggests that two ExtendedMessageFormat objects with different registries should have different hashcodes, which would be determined by how the registry is incorporated into the hashcode calculation, not by this utility method.

The `containsElements` method is just a helper to check if a collection has any non-null elements, and it's working as intended. The hashcode mismatch issue likely needs to be fixed in the main class's `hashCode()` implementation where it uses this method.
