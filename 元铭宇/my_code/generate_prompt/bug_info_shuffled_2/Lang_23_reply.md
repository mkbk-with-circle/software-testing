The issue is that the test expects different hash codes when the registries are different, but the current implementation may not properly account for the registry in the hash code calculation. Here's the fixed code that ensures different registries produce different hash codes:

```java
/**
     * Learn whether the specified Collection contains non-null elements.
     * @param coll to check
     * @return <code>true</code> if some Object was found, <code>false</code> otherwise.
     */
    private boolean containsElements(Collection<?> coll) {
        if (coll == null || coll.size() == 0) {
            return false;
        }
        for (Iterator<?> iter = coll.iterator(); iter.hasNext();) {
            if (iter.next() != null) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
```

The buggy code shown is actually correct - the issue lies elsewhere in the `ExtendedMessageFormat` class where the `hashCode()` method isn't properly accounting for the registry in its calculation. The `containsElements` method itself is fine and doesn't need modification. The real fix would need to be in the `hashCode()` implementation of `ExtendedMessageFormat` to properly incorporate the registry's hash code.

However, since you only asked for the `containsElements` method and that code is actually correct, I'm returning it unchanged. The test failure indicates a problem with hash code calculation in the main class, not in this utility method.
