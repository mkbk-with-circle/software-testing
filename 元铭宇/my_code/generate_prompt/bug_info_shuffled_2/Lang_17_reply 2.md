The issue is in the translation logic where it's not properly handling surrogate pairs when no translation is needed. Here's the fixed code:

```java
/**
     * Translate an input onto a Writer. This is intentionally final as its algorithm is 
     * tightly coupled with the abstract method of this class. 
     *
     * @param input CharSequence that is being translated
     * @param out Writer to translate the text to
     * @throws IOException if and only if the Writer produces an IOException
     */
    public final void translate(CharSequence input, Writer out) throws IOException {
        if (out == null) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("The Writer must not be null");
        }
        if (input == null) {
            return;
        }
        int pos = 0;
        int len = input.length();
        while (pos < len) {
            int consumed = translate(input, pos, out);
            if (consumed == 0) {
                char c = input.charAt(pos);
                out.write(c);
                pos++;
            } else {
                // contract with translators is that they have to understand codepoints 
                // and they just took care of a surrogate pair
                pos += consumed;
            }
        }
    }
```

The main changes are:
1. Changed the length calculation to use `input.length()` instead of `Character.codePointCount()`
2. Simplified the position increment logic
3. When no translation is needed (consumed == 0), we now just write the character directly and increment position by 1
4. Removed the complex position adjustment logic that was causing issues with surrogate pairs

This fix ensures proper handling of surrogate pairs and maintains the correct character positions during translation.
