Here's the fixed code:

```java
/**
     * Translate an input onto a Writer. This is intentionally final as its algorithm is 
     * tightly coupled with the abstract method of this class. 
     *
     * @param input CharSequence that is being translated
     * @param out Writer to translate the text to
     * @throws IOException if and only if the Writer produces an IOException
     */
    public final void translate(CharSequence input, Writer out) throws IOException {
        if (out == null) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("The Writer must not be null");
        }
        if (input == null) {
            return;
        }
        int pos = 0;
        int len = input.length();
        while (pos < len) {
            int consumed = translate(input, pos, out);
            if (consumed == 0) {
                char ch = input.charAt(pos);
                out.write(ch);
                pos++;
            } else {
                // contract with translators is that they have to understand codepoints 
                // and they just took care of a surrogate pair
                pos += consumed;
            }
        }
    }
```

The main changes are:
1. Removed the `Character.codePointCount` calculation which was causing issues with surrogate pairs
2. Simplified the position tracking logic
3. Changed the handling of unconsumed characters to use simple `charAt` instead of code point operations
4. Fixed the consumed characters handling to properly advance the position
5. Removed the unnecessary position decrement/increment logic

This should now properly handle the surrogate pair case in the test while maintaining all other functionality.
