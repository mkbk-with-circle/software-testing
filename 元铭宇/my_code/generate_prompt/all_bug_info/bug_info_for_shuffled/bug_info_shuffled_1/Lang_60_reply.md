Here's the fixed code. The issue was that the method was checking the entire buffer length instead of just the used portion (size) of the buffer.

```java
/**
     * Checks if the string builder contains the specified char.
     *
     * @param ch  the character to find
     * @return true if the builder contains the character
     */
    public boolean contains(char ch) {
        char[] thisBuf = buffer;
        for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
            if (thisBuf[i] == ch) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
```
