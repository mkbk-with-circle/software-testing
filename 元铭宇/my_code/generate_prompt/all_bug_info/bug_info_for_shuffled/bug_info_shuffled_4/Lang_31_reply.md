The bug occurs when checking supplementary characters (characters outside the Basic Multilingual Plane). The current implementation compares individual char values, but supplementary characters are represented by two char values (a surrogate pair). Here's the fixed code that properly handles supplementary characters:

```java
public static boolean containsAny(CharSequence cs, char[] searchChars) {
    if (isEmpty(cs) || ArrayUtils.isEmpty(searchChars)) {
        return false;
    }
    int csLength = cs.length();
    int searchLength = searchChars.length;
    for (int i = 0; i < csLength; i++) {
        char ch = cs.charAt(i);
        for (int j = 0; j < searchLength; j++) {
            if (searchChars[j] == ch) {
                // Check if we're dealing with a supplementary character
                if (Character.isHighSurrogate(ch)) {
                    if (j < searchLength - 1 && searchChars[j+1] == cs.charAt(i+1)) {
                        return true;
                    }
                } else if (!Character.isLowSurrogate(ch)) {
                    return true;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```

The fix:
1. Checks if the current character is a high surrogate (first part of a supplementary character)
2. If it is, verifies the next character matches the low surrogate
3. If it's not a surrogate character, proceeds with normal comparison
4. If it's a low surrogate without a matching high surrogate, skips it

This ensures proper handling of supplementary characters while maintaining the original functionality for regular characters.
