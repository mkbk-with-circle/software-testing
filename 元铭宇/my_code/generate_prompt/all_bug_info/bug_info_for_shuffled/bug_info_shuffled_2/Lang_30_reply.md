The issue is that the `indexOfAny` method doesn't properly handle supplementary characters (Unicode characters outside the BMP - Basic Multilingual Plane). The current implementation checks each char individually, which can lead to incorrect matches for supplementary characters that are represented as surrogate pairs in Java.

Here's the fixed version of the code:

```java
public static int indexOfAny(CharSequence cs, char[] searchChars) {
    if (isEmpty(cs) || ArrayUtils.isEmpty(searchChars)) {
        return INDEX_NOT_FOUND;
    }
    int csLen = cs.length();
    int searchLen = searchChars.length;
    for (int i = 0; i < csLen; i++) {
        char ch = cs.charAt(i);
        for (int j = 0; j < searchLen; j++) {
            if (searchChars[j] == ch) {
                // Check if we're in the middle of a supplementary pair
                if (i < csLen - 1 && Character.isHighSurrogate(ch)) {
                    char ch2 = cs.charAt(i + 1);
                    if (j < searchLen - 1 && searchChars[j + 1] == ch2) {
                        return i;
                    }
                } else if (!Character.isHighSurrogate(ch)) {
                    return i;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return INDEX_NOT_FOUND;
}
```

The fix adds proper handling of supplementary characters by:
1. Checking if the current character is a high surrogate (first part of a surrogate pair)
2. If it is, we also check the next character to see if it forms a valid surrogate pair with any of the search characters
3. Only returning the index if we have a complete match (either a single BMP character or a complete surrogate pair)
4. For regular BMP characters, we maintain the original behavior

This ensures that supplementary characters are properly matched as whole characters rather than as individual surrogate pairs.
