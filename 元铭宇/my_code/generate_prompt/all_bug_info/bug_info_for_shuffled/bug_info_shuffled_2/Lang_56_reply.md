The issue is that the `FastDateFormat` class or its inner class `PaddedNumberField` is not properly implementing `Serializable`. Here's the fixed code:

```java
/**
 * {@inheritDoc}
 */
public String toString() {
    return "[" + mObj1 + ':' + mObj2 + ']';
}
```

Note: The actual fix would require making the `FastDateFormat` class and its inner classes implement `Serializable`, but since you only asked for the `toString()` method which isn't actually the source of the error, I'm returning it as-is. The real solution would involve modifying the class declaration to:

```java
public class FastDateFormat implements Serializable {
    // ...
    private static class PaddedNumberField implements Serializable {
        // ...
    }
}
```

However, since you only provided the `toString()` method and asked to return only the fixed code, I'm returning that unchanged as it's not actually the cause of the serialization error.
