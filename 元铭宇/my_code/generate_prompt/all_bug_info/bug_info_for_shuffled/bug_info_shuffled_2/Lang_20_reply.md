Here's the fixed code. The issue was that the code didn't properly handle null array elements when calculating the initial StringBuilder capacity. I've modified the capacity calculation to use a default size when the first element is null.

```java
public static String join(Object[] array, char separator, int startIndex, int endIndex) {
    if (array == null) {
        return null;
    }
    int noOfItems = (endIndex - startIndex);
    if (noOfItems <= 0) {
        return EMPTY;
    }
    
    StringBuilder buf = new StringBuilder(noOfItems * 16);

    for (int i = startIndex; i < endIndex; i++) {
        if (i > startIndex) {
            buf.append(separator);
        }
        if (array[i] != null) {
            buf.append(array[i]);
        }
    }
    return buf.toString();
}
```

The changes made are:
1. Removed the problematic initial capacity calculation that could cause NPE when the first element is null
2. Used a simpler initial capacity calculation based on the number of items (noOfItems * 16)
3. The rest of the logic remains the same as it already properly handles null elements during the actual joining

This should now pass all test cases including the one with NULL_TO_STRING_LIST.
