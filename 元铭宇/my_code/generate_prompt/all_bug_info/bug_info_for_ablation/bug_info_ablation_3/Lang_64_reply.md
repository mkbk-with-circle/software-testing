The bug in the code is that it doesn't properly handle the case where the compared values might cause integer overflow. Here's the fixed version that uses Integer.compare() to avoid this issue:

```java
/**
     * <p>Tests for order.</p>
     *
     * <p>The default ordering is numeric by value, but this
     * can be overridden by subclasses.</p>
     *
     * <p>NOTE: From v2.2 the enums must be of the same type.
     * If the parameter is in a different class loader than this instance,
     * reflection is used to compare the values.</p>
     *
     * @see java.lang.Comparable#compareTo(Object)
     * @param other  the other object to compare to
     * @return -ve if this is less than the other object, +ve if greater than,
     *  <code>0</code> of equal
     * @throws ClassCastException if other is not an <code>Enum</code>
     * @throws NullPointerException if other is <code>null</code>
     */
    public int compareTo(Object other) {
        return Integer.compare(iValue, ((ValuedEnum) other).iValue);
    }
```

The fix replaces the simple subtraction with `Integer.compare()` which:
1. Properly handles integer overflow cases
2. Returns the same -1/0/+1 contract expected from compareTo
3. Is more explicit about the comparison being made
