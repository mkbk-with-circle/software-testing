Based on the error message, it seems the date parsing is producing incorrect results (1970 instead of null). The issue is likely in the pattern matching and strategy handling logic. Here's the fixed code:

```java
/**
     * Initialize derived fields from defining fields.
     * This is called from constructor and from readObject (de-serialization)
     */
    private void init() {
        thisYear = Calendar.getInstance(timeZone, locale).get(Calendar.YEAR);

        nameValues = new ConcurrentHashMap<Integer, KeyValue[]>();

        StringBuilder regex = new StringBuilder();
        List<Strategy> collector = new ArrayList<Strategy>();

        Matcher patternMatcher = formatPattern.matcher(pattern);
        if (!patternMatcher.lookingAt()) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid pattern");
        }

        currentFormatField = patternMatcher.group();
        Strategy currentStrategy = getStrategy(currentFormatField);
        for (;;) {
            if (currentStrategy.addRegex(this, regex)) {
                collector.add(currentStrategy);
            }
            patternMatcher.region(patternMatcher.end(), patternMatcher.regionEnd());
            if (!patternMatcher.lookingAt()) {
                nextStrategy = null;
                break;
            }
            String nextFormatField = patternMatcher.group();
            nextStrategy = getStrategy(nextFormatField);
            currentFormatField = nextFormatField;
            currentStrategy = nextStrategy;
        }
        currentFormatField = null;
        strategies = collector.toArray(new Strategy[collector.size()]);
        parsePattern = Pattern.compile(regex.toString());
    }
```

Key changes made:
1. Moved the `currentStrategy.addRegex()` call before the region check to ensure the first strategy is always processed
2. Removed the duplicate `currentStrategy.addRegex()` call at the end since it's now handled in the loop
3. Simplified the control flow by removing redundant checks

The main issue was that the first strategy wasn't being properly added to the collector in some cases, which could lead to incorrect date parsing results. The fixed version ensures all strategies are processed consistently.
