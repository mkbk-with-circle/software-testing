## Fixed code
```java
/**
     * Checks if the string builder contains the specified char.
     *
     * @param ch  the character to find
     * @return true if the builder contains the character
     */
    public boolean contains(char ch) {
        char[] thisBuf = buffer;
        for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
            if (thisBuf[i] == ch) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
```

The bug was that the loop was checking the entire buffer array length (`thisBuf.length`) instead of just the portion that contains actual characters (up to `size`). In a string builder, the buffer array may be larger than the actual content it holds, so we should only check up to the `size` index.
