The issue appears to be related to week number calculation in the date formatting. The test expects week 53 but gets week 01, which suggests we need to set the correct week calculation rules in the Calendar. Here's the fixed code:

```java
/**
     * <p>Formats a <code>Date</code> object.</p>
     * 
     * @param date  the date to format
     * @return the formatted string
     */
    public String format(Date date) {
        Calendar c = new GregorianCalendar(mTimeZone);
        c.setFirstDayOfWeek(Calendar.MONDAY);
        c.setMinimalDaysInFirstWeek(4);
        c.setTime(date);
        return applyRules(c, new StringBuffer(mMaxLengthEstimate)).toString();
    }
```

The fix adds two important Calendar configurations:
1. `setFirstDayOfWeek(Calendar.MONDAY)` - Sets Monday as the first day of the week
2. `setMinimalDaysInFirstWeek(4)` - Requires at least 4 days in the first week of the year

These settings align with ISO 8601 week date standards and will correctly calculate week 53 for certain dates at the end of December.
